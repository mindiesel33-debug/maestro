"""
Performance recommendation engine for the Performance Auto-Tune feature.

`recommend_settings(hw)` takes the dict from
`hardware_detect.detect_hardware()` and returns a dict of settings
to apply to wgp_config.json. Pure function — no side effects, no
imports beyond stdlib, easy to unit test.

The auto-apply helpers below update a supplied config dict, without disk or
runtime I/O, and track which recommendation revision owns each setting.

The recommendation table mirrors the design in
`memory/project_performance_auto.md`. Rationale lives there; this
module is just the lookup.

Coefficient policy (decided 2026-05-02):
- 0.80 across all tiers with VRAM ≥ 12 GB
- 0.70 for VRAM < 12 GB
- We do NOT bump above 0.80 even on 24 GB cards. Real-world data
  (user's RTX 4090) shows 0.80 sometimes OOMs on heavy workloads;
  going higher would be actively harmful.

#   - LoRA weights merged into the transformer (varies by file size)
#   - Multi-stage pipeline overhead (intermediate latents stay
#     resident across passes)
#
# Real-world data (RTX 4090, 24 GB):
#   LTX-2.3 dist 1.1, 720p × 20s, no LoRAs:
#     - 1 stage:  ~19 GB peak (matches 0.80 cap)
#     - 2 stage:  ~21 GB peak (over the cap by ~2 GB)
#     - + 3 LoRAs: 23.7+ GB peak (OOM territory)
#
# This helper computes a per-job effective coefficient that accounts
# for both factors, so the user's auto-tuned base can stay sensible
# (0.80) while real jobs get a tighter cap when they actually need it.

# Per additional pipeline stage at the BASELINE 720p resolution:
# ~2 GB of intermediate latent memory stays resident on top of stage
# 1's working set. Empirical from RTX 4090 stage-2 measurements at
# 720p; the actual per-stage cost scales with output resolution since
# stage 2 (refinement / upscale) operates at full output resolution
# and its activation peak grows linearly with pixel count.
#
# Calibrated 2026-05-15: a 20s × 1080p × 2-stage × no-LoRA job on
# RTX 4090 OOM'd on stage 2 with the previous flat-2.0 GB penalty
# (effective coef = 0.513 = 12.3 GB cap). Scaling pass overhead by
# the resolution factor (1080p = 2.25× of 720p baseline) raises the
# 1080p penalty to 4.5 GB, dropping the effective coef to ~0.41 (cap
# ~9.8 GB). That triggers more aggressive offload at stage 2 and

    This is intentionally separate from ``compute_per_job_coefficient``:

    resident.  On a 24 GB RTX 4090, 960x544 x 336 frames then raised the
    model cap to 19.3 GB and the process exited during its first denoising
    step.  The same class of jobs had worked under the old incidental
    two-stage reserve at roughly a 17.5 GB cap.

    ``runtime_workspace_gb`` is MMGP's transformer's measured working-VRAM
    allowance. MMGP receives it independently, while this function also uses
    it to keep the residency coefficient from occupying that same device
    headroom. The allowance blends in near the baseline rather than penalizing
    short previews, then scales to cover larger Q/K/V and residual tensors.
    Native canvases use partial excess scaling to retain useful model
    residency; experimental large canvases retain the stricter measured
    scaling that prevents the observed 1080p OOM.

    ``auto_resolution_pixels`` is the selected model's authoritative mapping
    for symbolic Auto presets. It must be applied here, before model loading,
    because the H3 handler resolves final aspect-aligned dimensions later.

    offloading); lighter jobs get a modest bonus (less offload, faster

        lora_dir: Directory containing the LoRA files. Used with
            active_loras to compute total LoRA bytes. If None, LoRA
            penalty is skipped (we can't size what we can't find).
        stage_count: Number of pipeline stages (1 = single,
            2 = standard, 3 = progressive). Each additional stage
            past 1 adds the per-stage overhead.
        resolution: Output resolution string ("WIDTHxHEIGHT") or None.
            None skips the compute-size penalty/bonus entirely.
        video_length_frames: Total output frames. None or 0 skips the
            compute-size penalty/bonus. (For images, pass 1.)
        model_activation_gb: Flat activation surcharge in GB for model
            classes whose conditioning inflates the attention sequence
            beyond what resolution × frames predicts (e.g. SCAIL-2
            appends the driving video as in-context tokens and prepends
            reference latents — ~35% more sequence than a classic Wan
            job at the same size). The generic compute curve rates such
            jobs "lighter than baseline" and would loosen the cap; this
            surcharge tightens it instead so activations fit. 0 = no-op.
