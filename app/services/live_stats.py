"""Lightweight live system telemetry for the hardware-status indicators.

Returns plain JSON numbers (CPU %, RAM, GPU utilization + VRAM) cheaply
enough to be polled every ~2 seconds by the frontend. This is the JSON
counterpart to the Gradio-era ``shared/utils/stats.py`` (which returns
HTML and blocks 1s on CPU sampling) — kept separate so the polled
endpoint stays dependency-light and non-blocking.

Design notes:
  - CPU uses ``psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)`` (non-blocking). It
    reports utilization since the *previous* call, so at a ~2s poll
    cadence each reading is a smooth trailing average over that window.
    We prime it once at import so the first real reading is meaningful
    rather than 0.0.
  - GPU goes through NVML (``pynvml``) — the same path stats.py uses —
    which reports *device-wide* VRAM (all processes), i.e. what a
    hardware monitor should show. NVIDIA only; on any other vendor /
    when NVML is unavailable we return ``available: False`` and the UI
    simply hides the GPU gauges.
  - Every metric is wrapped in try/except so a transient driver hiccup
    degrades one number to 0 instead of failing the whole poll.
