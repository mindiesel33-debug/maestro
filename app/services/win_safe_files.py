"""
Windows-safe file serving and deletion.

THE PROBLEM (Windows only):
Windows uses mandatory file locking. When a process opens a file, other
processes can't delete or rename it unless the opener passed
FILE_SHARE_DELETE to CreateFileW. Python's built-in open() does NOT
pass FILE_SHARE_DELETE — it uses FILE_SHARE_READ only.

Concrete consequence in this app:
- The browser plays a video clip via a <video> element. FastAPI's
  FileResponse opens the file with default share mode and streams it.
  HTTP keep-alive keeps the connection (and file handle) open for
  many seconds, sometimes minutes.
- The user clicks "delete" in the gallery. Backend calls os.remove
  → PermissionError. Falls back to os.rename → ALSO PermissionError
  (rename has the same share requirement as delete).
- The user is stuck with a "deleted" file that can't actually be
  removed without closing the entire app.

THE FIX (this module):
Open all served files with FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE |
FILE_SHARE_DELETE via CreateFileW. With share-delete set, Windows
behaves like POSIX — deletes and renames succeed immediately, the
inode lives until the last handle closes, and disk space is reclaimed
naturally.

USAGE:
- Replace `FileResponse(path)` with `share_delete_file_response(path)`
- Replace `os.remove(path)` in the gallery delete path with `safe_delete(path)`

Linux/macOS: these helpers fall back to standard FileResponse / os.remove,
since POSIX file semantics already give us this behavior for free.
