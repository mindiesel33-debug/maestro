Short Film Planner — creates a ProductionPlan from story/audio inputs.

Supports two paths:
  1. Audio-driven: dialogue audio + transcript → scene plans
  2. Story-driven: story description + characters → scene plans (no audio)

Outputs: ProductionPlan with ShotPlan objects (NOT final prompts).

# ── Pass 2 JSON output schemas (llama-server grammar constraint) ──────
# These mirror the JSON examples embedded in the Pass 2 / fallback system
# prompts. llama-server compiles the schema to a GBNF grammar that masks
# every token which would break it, so a constrained pass physically
# cannot emit prose, markdown fences, or repeat-loop garbage (the Gemma 4
# 12B failure: 96K chars of looping pseudo-JSON on a 5-min film).
#
# additionalProperties=False is the actual loop-killer: a grammar-compiled
# closed object emits each key AT MOST ONCE, in this defined order, so the
# "repeat the same field/object until max_tokens" failure class becomes
# unrepresentable. The flip side: any field a prompt's output spec asks
# for MUST be listed here, in spec order, or the grammar will forbid the
# model from writing it. If you add a field to a Pass 2 output spec,
# add it to _SHOT_PROPERTIES too.
#
# Strings stay unbounded (creative prose can't be length-capped at the
# grammar level) — intra-string repetition remains covered by the
# registry-level repeat penalties in llm_service.

ONE FILM, NOT DISCONNECTED VIGNETTES:
- Preserve every requested event, outcome, relationship, named identity, location requirement, and literal user-authored line in its original order. Do not replace the user's plot with a different premise.
- Establish one central dramatic objective or conflict. Every scene must change that same story by causing a decision, discovery, obstacle, consequence, escalation, climax, or resolution.
- If the user leaves a broad act underspecified (for example, "they team up and fight crime"), invent the SMALLEST coherent plot needed to complete it: one case, one objective, and one escalating chain. Do not fill runtime with unrelated criminals, emergencies, villains, locations, or sketches.
- Scene N+1 must happen BECAUSE OF something visible or spoken in scene N. Apply this removal test: if scene N could be deleted without changing why scene N+1 happens, repair the handoff.
- A location or time change is welcome when dramatically motivated. The outgoing scene must establish the decision, discovery, pursuit, dispatch, departure, consequence, or time transition; the next scene must open on its concrete result or arrival. Never teleport merely for visual variety.
- Carry persistent state forward: current objective, information learned, relationship changes, injuries, dirt or wardrobe damage, important props, who possesses them, and unresolved danger.
- Escalate toward one climax, then pay off both the external objective and the central relationship or character change. The final scene must resolve this film, not advertise an unrelated sequel.
- Use only camera-observable physical events in visible_beats. Dialogue will be authored in the next pass.
- Do not use generic placeholders such as "the story continues," "they move on," "next scene," or "another incident occurs." State the concrete cause and visible result.

FIELD CONTRACT:
- location_time: exact physical place and story time.
- active_objective: what the central character or team is trying to achieve NOW.
- story_purpose: the unique narrative change this scene earns.
- opening_cause: for scene 1, the initiating situation; afterward, the exact prior action, choice, discovery, or consequence that causes this scene and how its opening visibly shows the result.
- visible_beats: ordered camera-observable actions that deliver the scene.
- choice_or_discovery: the new choice, information, reversal, or consequence produced here.
- outgoing_handoff: for every non-final scene, the concrete on-screen beat that motivates the next scene; for the final scene, the completed payoff.
- persistent_state_after: the objective, knowledge, relationship, physical damage, wardrobe, and prop state that the next scene inherits."""

Return ONLY a JSON array. Include one object for each person who may speak in the supplied concept, and no one else.

For an established fictional character named by the user, use the character's established personality, vocabulary, sentence rhythm, comic or dramatic behavior, and relationships to the other supplied characters. Capture why the character is recognizable beyond a single stereotype. Copyright-safe originality means fresh dialogue, not bland dialogue: do not quote or reproduce signature lines or catchphrases, but do preserve the character's recognizable decision-making and conversational behavior.

CASTING IS NOT CHARACTERIZATION: When the concept says "Actor as Character," the actor supplies visual casting and screen presence while the fictional Character supplies biography, nationality, accent, vocabulary, slang, relationships, and behavior. Never transfer an actor's real nationality, accent, public persona, or personal speech habits into the role unless the user explicitly requests that adaptation. If a performer is named without playing a fictional role, follow the user's description rather than inventing private traits.

For an original character, infer only what the concept and supplied character card support. Do not invent a biography that changes the story. Do not list a TV series, franchise, location, or group as a character.

Fields:
- character_name: the exact supplied character name.
- personality_engine: concrete wants, pressure responses, defenses, habits, contradictions, and choices that shape this character. Describe playable behavior, not an abstract theme such as order, chaos, perfection, or grit.
- speech_pattern: concrete vocabulary level, syntax, rhythm, interruptions, formality, subtext, humor, and recurring conversational tactics. Describe how the character constructs and avoids thoughts, not a fixed sentence or word count.
- relationship_behavior: how this character specifically pursues, resists, needles, reassures, lies to, protects, or reacts to each other supplied cast member.
- performance_direction: concise audible cadence, energy, register, and emotional delivery guidance; describe qualities, not an actor voice clone.
- avoid: generic caricatures, vocabulary this person would not use, and other out-of-character failure modes.

VOICE-BIBLE QUALITY RULES:
- Silently inhabit each character in the exact project situation before writing the profile: what do they want right now, what are they unwilling to admit, and what verbal tactic do they use on the other person? Output the profile, not the rehearsal and not sample dialogue.
- Character traits are ACTING INSTRUCTIONS, never proposed conversation topics. A disciplined character behaves and speaks decisively; they do not explain "consistency." A rough character chooses blunt concrete words; they do not lecture about "chaos" or "grit."
- Prefer concrete, speakable language over psychological, academic, corporate, or thesaurus language. Record the tempting-but-wrong register in avoid so the screenplay writer can reject it.
- Apply the name-hidden test: the eventual wording, tactics, and reactions should identify the speaker even with the character heading removed.
- Never prescribe a numerical word range, maximum word count, or constant one-word/two-word response pattern for a character.
- "Terse," "direct," or "economical" describes diction and cadence, not permanently tiny lines. Every character must be able to express complete responsive thoughts when the dramatic beat needs them.
- Preserve recognizable differences through vocabulary, syntax, subtext, conversational tactics, and relationships. Do not manufacture distinctness by reducing everyone to fragments or catchphrases.
- Encourage varied line lengths across an exchange: clipped reactions where natural, fuller responses where meaning, comedy, conflict, or emotion needs room.

Keep each field concise and practical for a small local screenwriting model."""

Return ONLY one JSON array row for every turn in the supplied MANIFEST BATCH. Keep the same global turn number, speaker, order, intent, plot facts, and conversational response relationship. Do not add or remove turns. original_text must be copied exactly into the corresponding output row. The full screenplay is context only; never return rows for dialogue turns outside the supplied batch.

Make each revised_text sound unmistakably appropriate to that character: established personality, vocabulary, syntax, cadence, comic or dramatic mechanism, and relationship to the person being addressed. Preserve nuance; do not reduce a character to one exaggerated trait. Write fresh dialogue and never copy famous lines or catchphrases.

Before revising each turn, silently inhabit the speaker and rehearse the exchange from inside their point of view: What do they want from the listener right now? What are they hiding or refusing to say directly? Do they attack, dodge, charm, tease, reassure, lecture, deflect, or go quiet? How do they react to the exact preceding line or visible action? Then write only revised_text and delivery.

CHARACTER-VOICE ACCEPTANCE TEST:
- Apply the name-hidden recognition test: with speaker_name hidden, a viewer familiar with the character should still recognize who chose those words and that conversational tactic.
- Express personality THROUGH diction, rhythm, subtext, reaction, and behavior. Never make characters discuss voice-bible abstractions such as their own order, chaos, consistency, perfection, grit, worldview, or personality unless the story itself requires that literal topic.
- Plain spoken words beat elevated synonyms. Never replace "good enough" with "adequate," "problem" with "core issue," or ordinary banter with academic, corporate, therapeutic, technical, or production-design language merely to make it different.
- Preserve a natural original line when it already passes the test. revised_text may exactly equal original_text. Change only what becomes more speakable, responsive, and character-authentic.
- Keep the character's intelligence and nuance, but do not confuse intelligence with formality. Read every revision aloud mentally; if the person would not actually say it under this pressure, rewrite it.

If user_locked is true, revised_text MUST exactly equal original_text. Otherwise tighten stiff, formal, generic, fragmentary, or AI-like phrasing while preserving meaning, plot facts, and the line's immediate dramatic job. A terse character may use economical diction, but "terse" never imposes a fixed word count. Vary line lengths, use complete responsive thoughts, preserve subtext, and let each reply react specifically to what was just said or done. Do not turn an exchange into a chain of one-word or two-word fragments. Keep the batch within its stated spoken-word budget and never make an individual turn longer than {maximum_line_words} words.

delivery is a concise performance direction for that specific line. Describe cadence, energy, pitch/register, hesitation, interruption, or emotional pressure. Do not request an exact actor voice or voice impersonation."""

{visual_strategy_rules}

You are planning visuals for a scene where the AUDIO ALREADY EXISTS. The dialogue is pre-recorded.
The supplied audio owns every audible voice. dialogue_beats may repeat transcript lines for timing,
speaker assignment, and acting reference only. Never quote, tag, or request those words as new speech
in video_prompt; keep the visible performance, actions, camera work, and continuity synchronized to
the supplied track without replacing or duplicating it.

FULL DIALOGUE TRANSCRIPT:
{full_transcript if full_transcript else "(no transcript available)"}

STORY CONCEPT: {story_description}

Plan each shot as a structured scene — deciding visuals, camera, action, mood,
and how performers visibly react in time with the existing audio. Write a DETAILED {"video_prompt and image_prompt" if uses_generated_images else "video_prompt"} for each shot.

{char_rules}

{camera_block}

SHORT FILM PLANNING RULES:
- The audio is PRE-RECORDED — you are planning VISUALS to match existing dialogue.
- Focus on acting, body language, and emotional expression that matches what's being said.
- Treat dialogue_beats as a transcript for timing, speaker assignment, and acting only. Do not copy, quote, or tag its words in video_prompt; the supplied track already contains them.
- Stage visible reactions and physical business in sync with the supplied speech, keeping the established action and continuity.
- Match camera complexity to emotional tone: steady for intimate, dynamic for action.
- Each shot should advance the story or reveal character.
- Describe the ENVIRONMENT in detail for each shot (room, furniture, lighting, time of day).
- video_prompt MUST be a full detailed paragraph (80-150 words) — NOT a brief label.
{image_planning_rules}

VIDEO PROMPT (video_prompt) — follow the LTX-2 style guide below closely:
- One single flowing paragraph, present tense, 4-8 sentences.
- Start with shot type and visual style early.
- Characters: {"preserve supplied proper names and add useful visible traits (clothing, hair, posture, expression)" if preserve_names else "describe by visible traits (clothing, hair, posture, expression)"}.
- Emotion through PHYSICAL CUES only (jaw tightens, fists clench, shoulders drop) — never abstract labels like "serious expression" or "looks determined".
- Action: chronological order — setup, movement, reaction, final beat.
- Camera: explicit movement tied to the subject (slow dolly in, tracking left, orbit around, handheld follow) — never vague ("digital drift", "cinematic camera").
- Audio: include ambient sound when relevant, and any other sounds or sound effects that are relevant to the scene.
- Dialogue: describe the visible delivery and lip movement without writing dialogue text; supplied audio already contains every spoken line.
- NEVER say montage, quick cuts, cut to.

WINDOW PROMPTS vs VIDEO PROMPT — use ONE or the OTHER, never both:
- Scenes 20s or under: write video_prompt, leave window_prompts as [].
- Scenes over 20s: write window_prompts, leave video_prompt as "".
  Each window covers ~20s. Windows play SEQUENTIALLY — window 2 continues exactly
  where window 1 left off, picking up the action mid-flow.
  CRITICAL: The video model only sees the last few frames — it has NO memory of
  earlier action or sound. Each window must briefly re-establish ongoing state
  (e.g. "the audience continues cheering" or "rain still falling") before
  describing new action. Without this, ongoing activity abruptly stops.
  Example: Window 1 delivers the joke → Window 2: "The audience continues laughing
  and clapping. She takes a bow, wipes her brow, and walks to stage left..."

HARD LENGTH BUDGET — NON-NEGOTIABLE FOR THIS SCREENPLAY:
- Target duration: {target_duration} seconds.
- Maximum SPOKEN dialogue across the entire screenplay: {max_spoken_words} words.
  (Aim for {DIALOGUE_DEFAULT_WORDS_PER_SECOND:g} words/second during speech; allow up to {DIALOGUE_MAX_WORDS_PER_SECOND:g}.
  Leave time for requested action and pauses; do not add dialogue just to fill this budget.)
- Maximum TOTAL screenplay length (dialogue + action lines + scene headings):
  approximately {max_total_words} words.
- Aim for {scene_count_low}-{scene_count_high} distinct scenes total.
  Fewer, fuller scenes always beat many short ones.

WHEN YOU NOTICE THE SCREENPLAY GETTING LONG — CUT, DON'T SPLIT:
- If you have written more than {max_spoken_words} words of dialogue, you are
  OVER BUDGET. Do NOT split into more scenes. Do NOT add a Pass 2
  consolidation step — there isn't one. Instead:
    * DROP a beat entirely (does the story actually need this exchange?).
    * SHORTEN a beat (one back-and-forth instead of three).
    * CONDENSE multi-line speeches into a single direct line.
- A {target_duration}-second film is SHORT. Pick the {scene_count_low}-{scene_count_high} most
  essential beats and write THOSE well. Save the rest for a longer cut.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Downstream Pass 2 splits the screenplay into shots; the video model
  generates each shot. If your screenplay implies 300 seconds of action,
  Pass 2 has TWO bad choices: (a) inflate total runtime to {int(target_duration * 1.7)}+
  seconds (overshoots user's target), or (b) cram 300s of content into
  {target_duration}s of shots (rushed, characters speak too fast, motion blurs).
  Both produce a worse film than a {target_duration}s screenplay paced for {target_duration}s.

CAUSAL FILM CONTINUITY — BINDING STORY CONTRACT:
- Write ONE coherent film, never a reel of loosely related scenes. Establish a central objective or conflict, escalate it, reach one climax, and earn a resolution.
- Every scene after the first must be caused by an action, choice, discovery, pursuit, dispatch, departure, or consequence in the scene before it. A new scene heading is not permission to teleport.
- When place or time changes, visibly establish the reason before the cut and open the next scene on the resulting arrival or consequence. Location variety is welcome only when the story motivates it.
- End every non-final scene with a concrete handoff that makes the next scene necessary. Apply the deletion test: if removing the prior scene would not change why the next scene happens, repair the transition.
- Carry forward the active objective, knowledge, relationship change, injuries, dirt or wardrobe damage, and important props. A character cannot forget what just happened merely because the camera cut.
- Do not invent an unrelated villain, emergency, crime, location, or subplot to fill runtime. When the user's later act is broad, choose the smallest single conflict that pays off the established setup and relationship.
- Preserve the user's ordered events and literal spoken lines. The structured blueprint may clarify bridges, but it never overrides the user's source concept.
- In screenplay prose, the first camera-observable actions after each new scene heading must show its opening cause/result, and the final actions before the next heading must show its outgoing handoff. Do not print blueprint labels or planning commentary.

H3 CHARACTER-AUTHENTICITY RULES:
- Before drafting, use the binding voice bible below as the cast's dialogue and relationship logic.
- For an established fictional character named by the user, write fresh dialogue consistent with the character's established personality, vocabulary, syntax, cadence, comic/dramatic mechanism, and relationships. Do not copy famous dialogue or catchphrases.
- Treat "Actor as Character" as visual casting, not a personality transplant. The fictional character—not the performer—governs nationality, accent, slang, biography, relationships, and dialogue unless the user explicitly requests a reinterpretation.
- Silently embody the speaker before every generated line. Decide what they want from the listener in that beat, what they will not admit, and the character-specific tactic they use to get it. Write the result, never the rehearsal or an explanation of the profile.
- Character traits are performance engines, not dialogue subjects. Show discipline through decisive choices, anger through pressure and word choice, wit through a targeted reaction, and intelligence through insight. Do not make the cast literally debate abstract profile labels such as order, chaos, consistency, perfection, grit, worldview, or personality unless the user's story makes that the subject.
- Use the name-hidden test: if a generated line could belong to another member of the cast after removing the heading, rewrite its diction, syntax, subtext, or tactic until the speaker is recognizable.
- Prefer plain, speakable, situation-specific words. Do not "improve" dialogue with academic, corporate, therapeutic, technical, or thesaurus phrasing that the character would not choose aloud under pressure.
- Do not reduce a recognizable character to one generic trait. A line that could be reassigned to another cast member without sounding wrong must be rewritten.
- Preserve every literal line supplied by the user exactly. Character-authentic writing changes generated dialogue, never user-authored dialogue.
- Treat the named cast as CLOSED: use only people named in the user's concept, supplied character references, and binding voice bible. Unnamed background extras are allowed when the setting needs them, but never add a named cameo, familiar franchise character, friend, relative, or celebrity the user did not request.
- Every generated spoken turn must be a complete thought of no more than {h3_maximum_line_words} words so it can be performed inside one native H3 clip. Never end a generated turn with a continuation ellipsis and never split one character's sentence across clips; shorten it or turn the next idea into a natural reply from another character.
- Treat "terse," "direct," and "economical" as style guidance, never as a fixed line-length rule. Use varied line lengths and complete responsive thoughts; do not build an exchange from a chain of one-word or two-word fragments.
- Every generated reply must respond specifically to the preceding action or line, carry subtext or character intent, and move the relationship or story forward. Prefer substantial back-and-forth over disconnected labels, counters, and generic acknowledgements.
- Silently conduct a table read before returning the screenplay: remove generic sitcom filler, stiff exposition, invented gimmicks, and words the named speaker would not naturally choose.

- The screenplay and binding blueprint below describe one film. Preserve their central objective, scene order, consequences, relationship changes, physical damage, and prop state.
- A location/time cut must be motivated by the outgoing scene and must open on the resulting arrival or consequence. Never create an unrelated scene merely for visual variety.
- Every shot advances the same causal chain. Do not invent a new antagonist, emergency, crime, objective, location, or subplot that is absent from both authorities.
- When a scene spans multiple shots/windows, preserve its geography and state. When a new scene begins, carry forward everything the screenplay has not visibly changed.

  instead of the flowing Format A paragraph. The storyboard format
  is the "Shot 1 (Camera, Xs): ..." structured form that the IC-LoRA
  renders as internal camera cuts. The decision is per generation,
  not per shot — a 40s shot can have one storyboard window and one
  flowing window, in which case multishot still equals true.

- window_prompts vs. video_prompt is determined by duration_sec ALONE.
  Use this STRICT decision (no soft zone, no "around 20"):
    duration_sec ≤ 20  → video_prompt populated, window_prompts MUST be []
    duration_sec ≥ 21  → window_prompts populated, video_prompt MUST be ""
  Every shot uses EXACTLY one of the two — never both, never neither.
  21s, 22s, 25s ALL count as "≥ 21" → these MUST use window_prompts.
  Window count for ≥ 21s shots:
    21-40s → 2 windows
    41-60s → 3 windows
    61-80s → 4 windows
  Each window covers ~20s of video. Windows play SEQUENTIALLY — window 2
  continues exactly where window 1 left off, picking up the action mid-flow.
  The video model only sees the last few frames between windows — re-establish
  ongoing state (crowd cheering, rain falling, music playing) at the start
  of each window.
- Each window prompt MUST be a full detailed paragraph (80-150 words).
  Do NOT reuse the same prompt for multiple windows — each window describes
  a different portion of the scene's action chronologically.
{video_name_rules}

PACING — match shot length to story beat, not to a "preferred" average:
- Total duration must sum to ~{target_duration}s.
- KEEP CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER. If two characters are mid-exchange, that is ONE shot — do NOT cut
  mid-conversation into separate shots. A 40s dialogue is one 40s scene with window_prompts,
  not three 13s scenes. Cutting mid-dialogue forces new start images, breaks character
  consistency, and wastes generation time.
- Cut to a new shot when ANY of these is true: location changes, a new character enters,
  a significant time jump, a clear story beat ends and a new one begins, OR a brief reaction
  is the entire dramatic point of the moment.
- Shot-length menu (use the whole range — variety is good filmmaking, not bias toward long):
    * 3-8s   — single reaction, glance, visual punctuation, establishing detail
    * 6-15s  — brief action, transition, short establishing shot
    * 15-40s — dialogue exchange, focused continuous action (one or two windows)
    * 40-80s — sustained scene (multiple windows, conversation that earns its length)
- STRICT 20s threshold: shots ≤ 20s use a single video_prompt with window_prompts=[];
  shots ≥ 21s use window_prompts (one per ~20s slice) with video_prompt="".
  21s, 22s, 25s ALL require window_prompts — there is no "soft zone".

        # When the user has enabled multi-shot LoRA mode (a toggle in
        # services config; defaults off), Pass 2 gets supplementary
        # guidance for mixed-format output.
        #
        # Architecture (revised after first user test):
        # The unit of decision is the GENERATION, not the shot. A
        # generation is one LTX-2 call producing ≤20s of video. Mapping:
        #   - 20s shot = 1 generation (the video_prompt itself)
        #   - 40s shot = 2 generations (each window_prompt is one)
        #   - 60s shot = 3 generations (each window_prompt is one)
        #   - 80s shot = 4 generations (each window_prompt is one)
        #
        # For EACH generation independently, the LLM picks one of two
        # formats:
        #   1. SINGLE-CAMERA FLOWING (default): a flowing paragraph
        #      describing one continuous take.
        #   2. STORYBOARD MULTI-SHOT: a series of "Shot N (Camera, Xs):
        #      description" blocks describing internal camera cuts that
        #      the IC-LoRA will render within the single generation.
        #
        # When to use storyboard: dialogue exchanges, multi-beat
        # interaction, scenes where camera variety helps. When to keep
        # flowing: sustained single beats (a kiss, a sex act, a held
        # reaction), punchy moments, ambient establishing shots.
        #
        # Each window in a 40s+ shot can use a different format —

        # LLM is forced to mix in 40s/60s/80s buckets. This is the
        # only reliable way to get long shots; prompt-level "use long
        # buckets" guidance alone has been observed to be ignored

TASK: Break this {target_duration}-second screenplay into {shot_count_low}-{shot_count_high} distinct shots.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (these override any conflicting system-prompt guidance):

1. EXACTLY {shot_count_low} TO {shot_count_high} SHOTS. No more. Going over this count
   means you're fragmenting — every shot under 20s is a sign you cut where
   the video model could have rendered continuous action. Re-merge.

2. SHOT DURATION MUST BE ONE OF: 20, 40, 60, 80 seconds.
   - 20s = single beat (a transition, a brief reaction, an
     establishing moment, a short dialogue exchange). One prompt,
     no windows.
   - 40s = TWO connected beats that flow together as one continuous
     scene (an extended dialogue, a foreplay-to-act transition, a
     slow reveal, a full kiss + embrace). USE FREELY — don't default
     to two 20s shots when the screenplay has a continuous 40s beat.
     Two windows.
   - 60s = THREE connected beats in one sustained scene (a long
     romantic encounter, a sex sequence, a confrontation that builds
     and breaks). Three windows. Common in NSFW films and any film
     with sustained dramatic scenes — don't avoid 60s shots.
   - 80s = FOUR connected beats in a single uninterrupted sequence
     (a sustained sex act, a long climactic confrontation, an extended
     seduction). Four windows. Use when the screenplay has a beat
     that genuinely needs the breathing room.
   - HEURISTIC: aim for variety. A {target_duration}s film with NINE
     20s shots feels choppy; a film with three 20s shots + two 40s +
     one 60s feels cinematic. Mix the bucket sizes.
   - NEVER 5, 8, 10, 15, 22, 25, 30, 35, 45, 50, 55, 65, 70, 75. Those
     all create stranded short tail windows that render as sluggish stubs.

3. TOTAL duration_sec MUST sum to {target_duration} seconds (±5%).
   With 20s shots that's exactly {target_duration // 20} shots. With one
   40s shot mixed in, the rest fit into {(target_duration - 40) // 20} 20s shots.

4. POPULATION RULE — single hard threshold (THIS RULE OVERRIDES THE
   MULTI-SHOT LORA MODE BLOCK BELOW IF YOU TRY TO BREAK IT):
   - duration_sec == 20 → populate video_prompt, window_prompts=[]
   - duration_sec ∈ {{40, 60, 80}} → populate window_prompts (one per 20s),
     video_prompt=""
   Each window is a full paragraph (80-150 words) describing 20s of action.
   {multishot_user_anchor}

5. THE VIDEO MODEL HANDLES INTRA-SHOT PROGRESSION. ONE 20s shot can show
   the woman walking closer, raising her hand to his chest, kneeling, and
   beginning a new action — the model renders all of that from
   {generation_inputs}. You do NOT need separate shots for "she steps
   closer", "her hand moves", "she kneels", "she begins to..." — those
   are micro-beats, NOT shot boundaries.

   ONLY cut to a new shot when ONE of these changes:
     - LOCATION (different room, indoor↔outdoor)
     - TIME (skip ahead — "later that evening")
     - CAST (a new character enters / someone exits)
     - DRAMATIC PIVOT (clear emotional inflection)
   DO NOT cut for: position, gesture, expression, camera movement, or
   action progression within an ongoing scene.

WHEN THE SCREENPLAY IS TOO DENSE FOR {target_duration}s — DROP CONTENT, DON'T ADD SHOTS:
The user asked for {target_duration} seconds. If the screenplay implies more, do NOT
solve it by adding more shots or stretching duration_sec. Instead:
  * DROP whole beats from the screenplay (a transition, a redundant line).
  * MERGE adjacent beats into one shot — most multi-beat content fits in
    a single 20s shot's prompt.
  * SHORTEN dialogue (cut the second back-and-forth, condense speeches).
A {shot_count_high}-shot film at 20s each is {shot_count_high * 20}s. If your plan
exceeds that count or that total, you are fragmenting or over-budget — re-plan.

SHOT BOUNDARIES (do not overlap):
Each shot covers a distinct, NON-overlapping span of the screenplay's
timeline. If Shot 2 covers minute 0:00-0:30 of action, Shot 3 starts at 0:30
and never re-uses lines from Shot 2. Do NOT include the same dialogue
exchange across multiple shots.

The user's original request:
{story_description}

BINDING STORY-ARCHITECT BLUEPRINT:
{story_blueprint_text}

Treat the screenplay as the final performed story and the blueprint as its
causal continuity ledger. At every location/time change, include the written
handoff and resulting arrival/consequence in the appropriate shot prompts.

Shot-construction rules:
- KEEP CONTINUOUS ACTION TOGETHER — physical progression that flows from one beat to the next is ONE shot. See the WRONG/RIGHT examples above. The video model handles intra-shot action progression; do not fragment.
- KEEP CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER — one conversation = one shot, using window_prompts if over 20s.
- MIX BUCKET SIZES. Use 40s for connected dialogue/action pairs. Use 60s for long romantic / dramatic / sex scenes. Use 80s for genuinely sustained sequences. With only {shot_count_high} shots allowed total, you CANNOT hit {target_duration}s using only 20s — the math forces you to use longer buckets. That is intentional: longer buckets produce more cinematic, less choppy films.
- Only cut to a new shot when location changes, a new character enters, or there's a clear dramatic beat transition (see strict criteria above).
- Preserve ALL dialogue from the screenplay verbatim — but each line goes in EXACTLY ONE shot/window, never repeated.

        # mid-bucket durations that violate the model's window-
        # threshold rules.

        #
        # Tier 1 — accept (≤15% over):
        #   The LLM's overshoot is small enough to live with. Log it
        #   and move on. This handles the common case where Pass 1
        #   was a bit dense and Pass 2 ended at, say, 200s for a 180s
        #   target. User gets a 200s film with clean buckets — better
        #   than an exact 180s film with 17s shots.
        #
        # Tier 2 — bucket-aware reduction (15% to 50% over):
        #   Find shots in larger buckets (40/60/80s) and snap each
        #   down to the next-smaller bucket until total fits. Each
        #   snap removes exactly 20s of runtime AND one window of
        #   content (the last window of that shot). Preserves the
        #   bucket grid; the only "compression" is dropping content,
        #   not stretching it.
        #
        # Tier 3 — proportional fallback (>50% over):
        #   Runaway LLM. Apply proportional scale, then run a final
        #   snap-to-bucket cleanup that rounds each shot back to a
        #   valid bucket value (20/40/60/80). The result may exceed

        #    (e.g. 25s, 35s, 45s), the backend allocates 20s to each full
        #    window and gives the tail window only the remainder. A 25s
        #    shot with 2 windows gets W1=20s, W2=5s — the 5s window is
        #    far too short to fit the dialogue/action the LLM wrote for
        #    it. Empirically, anything <10s of tail is "rushed". Fix by
        #    merging the rushed tail into the previous window AND snapping

                # (40, 60, 80) for sustained continuous action that
                # genuinely warrants the longer runtime. NEVER 22s, 25s,
                # 30s, 35s, 45s — these create stranded tail windows
                # (e.g. a 25s shot is W1=20s + W2=5s, where W2 renders
                # as a sluggish stub and the cut into the next shot
                # feels jagged).
                #
                # The Pass 2 user prompt already tells the LLM "duration
                # MUST be one of 20/40/60/80". This post-process is the
                # safety net for when the LLM picks an invalid value
                # anyway. Snap direction picks the NEAREST valid bucket:
                #
                #   tail = duration_sec % 20
                #   tail == 0       → already valid, no change
                #   1 ≤ tail ≤ 10   → snap DOWN (subtract tail, merge
                #                     last window's content into previous)
                #   11 ≤ tail ≤ 19  → snap UP (add 20-tail seconds, last
                #                     window covers a longer effective
                #                     time but receives no extra content)
                #
                # Why split the snap direction at the midpoint: if the
                # LLM wrote 25s of content (tail=5), it sized only ~15-30
                # words for the tail window. Snapping down merges those
                # words into the previous 20s window — minor compression,
                # acceptable. If the LLM wrote 35s of content (tail=15),
                # the tail window has a near-full 60-100 words. Cramming
                # those into the previous 20s window would rush dialogue
                # significantly. Snapping up to 40s preserves pacing
                # (the 5s expansion just gives the last window a few
                # extra seconds of breathing room). 40s shots are
                # explicitly allowed by the new rule.
                #

        pass2_system = f"""You are a film director breaking a screenplay into shots for MiniMax H3. Output ONLY the JSON array.

H3 NATIVE SHOT CONTRACT — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Every array item is ONE bounded H3 generation lasting {minimum_seconds:.2f}-{maximum_seconds:.2f} seconds.
- Use video_prompt for every item and set window_prompts to []. Never write 20-second windows, timeline ranges, or prompt instructions referring to a previous/preceding shot. The structured continuity_strategy and continuity_group fields are required planning metadata, while every video_prompt must remain self-contained.
- Every video_prompt must stand alone, but it must also be economical: normally 180-450 words and never more than 650 words. State the exact physical setting, visible people, essential appearance/wardrobe, chronological action, camera, lighting, dialogue, ambience, effects, and music once each. Do not paste the screenplay, story bible, production contract, or continuity metadata into the prompt; translate them into concrete visible/audible instructions. Never restate the same opening, action, speaker, or ending in multiple differently worded paragraphs.
- WARDROBE IS STATE: on every appearance, subjects_on_screen must give each person a complete head-to-toe wardrobe (colors, materials, layers, accessories, and visible footwear). Repeat the same wardrobe wording in every shot within a continuity_group unless the screenplay explicitly changes it, and show that change visibly before using the new wardrobe.
- BLOCKING IS STATE: spatial_setup and each subject's position_or_relation describe the FIRST FRAME precisely: screen-left/center/right, foreground/midground/background, standing/seated/leaning, facing direction, and nearby furniture or props. Repeat that opening blocking in video_prompt.
- closing_blocking describes the final positions at the end of the shot. When the next shot in the same continuity_group opens with different blocking, the current shot must visibly show the person walking, sitting, standing, turning, or otherwise moving into that next arrangement before the cut.
- continuity_strategy is "independent" for a new place/time, "continuous" for a normal editorial cut within the same scene, or "extend_previous" ONLY when the next generation should start from the literal final frame with the same camera axis/composition and no intended cut. Use extend_previous sparingly.
- continuity_group is a short stable ID such as kitchen_morning_1. Reuse it only while place and story time remain uninterrupted; change it for any location or time jump.
- "independent" means the video generation does not inherit a literal prior frame; it NEVER means narratively unrelated. Every shot remains part of one causal film.
- CAUSAL SCENE HANDOFFS ARE REQUIRED: when continuity_group changes, the final shot in the outgoing group must contain the screenplay's visible decision, discovery, departure, pursuit, dispatch, or consequence that motivates the change, and the first shot in the new group must open on its concrete result or arrival. Never teleport characters to a visually interesting location without a story reason.
- STORY STATE IS CONTINUOUS ACROSS GROUPS: carry the active objective, information learned, relationship changes, injuries, dirt or wardrobe damage, and important props even when the physical location changes.
- story_scene_number maps every shot to the corresponding ordered scene in the binding blueprint. Multiple coverage shots may share one story_scene_number, but scene numbers never move backward or skip the screenplay's causal events.
- causal_handoff is camera-observable story context, not an editing instruction. On the first shot of a scene it states the exact prior cause and visible arrival/result; on later coverage in the same scene it states the immediately preceding action or consequence that this shot advances.
- persistent_story_state states the current objective, knowledge, relationship, physical damage, wardrobe/prop state, and unresolved danger that remain true at this point. Repeat the relevant state instead of silently resetting it at a cut.
- Do not invent a new villain, emergency, crime, objective, or location that is absent from both the screenplay and the binding story blueprint. Shot planning directs and photographs the written film; it does not replace it with disconnected coverage.
- WORLD CONTINUITY IS REQUIRED: preserve any supplied TV show, film, performer, franchise, historical era, city, named venue, room, or recognizable set. Repeat the relevant world/franchise and full location in EACH video_prompt; never collapse a named series and its recognizable apartment set into a generic kitchen.
- Each screenplay event and each spoken line appears in exactly one shot. Do not duplicate dialogue across adjacent shots. Preserve scripted dialogue verbatim.
- CONVERSATION PACKING IS REQUIRED: a change of speaker is not by itself a reason to start another array item. Within the same uninterrupted location and story beat, prefer one native clip ({preferred_duration_text}) containing 2-4 alternating dialogue turns when their combined total is no more than {maximum_dialogue_words} words. Keep a brief reaction such as "What?", a gasp, or a one-line reply in the surrounding exchange instead of wasting a separate minimum-length clip.
- INTERNAL CAMERA EDITING IS SUPPORTED: inside one bounded H3 clip, the camera may begin on an ensemble frame, cut or reframe to each current speaker before their tagged line, hold their unobstructed face and mouth through the complete line, capture reactions, and finish on a new composition. Describe that chronological coverage in camera_plan and action_beats. Prefer the lower end of the requested shot-count range for a continuous dialogue scene.
- DIALOGUE CAMERA COVERAGE IS REQUIRED: do not leave a dialogue scene entirely in a wide master. Use a wide or two-shot only to establish geography or cover large action, then cut or reframe to motivated medium close-ups or over-the-shoulder angles for each line and listener reactions. Vary shot size by dramatic purpose across adjacent clips; do not default every clip to the same wide framing.
- DIALOGUE LANGUAGE IS PER LINE: set dialogue_beats[].language to the actual spoken language of that exact line, following the binding screenplay. Preserve the screenplay's words and language; do not translate dialogue into English. Mixed-language screenplays may use a different language on each beat.
- DIALOGUE MUST NOT LIVE ONLY IN dialogue_beats. Every dialogue_beats[].spoken_text must also appear exactly once in the same shot's video_prompt as <d>[the beat's language] Exact words</d>, with the speaker ID/name, delivery, and physical cue outside the tag. If dialogue_beats is empty, explicitly state that no one speaks, mouths remain closed, and no muttering, gibberish, or speech-like vocalization occurs.
- SPEAKER VISIBILITY IS REQUIRED: every person who delivers a line must have a complete subjects_on_screen entry and remain visibly framed with an unobstructed face and mouth for the full line. Reframe to the current speaker before speech; reaction framing may follow only after the spoken line is complete.
- CAST LIST CONSISTENCY IS REQUIRED: every person mentioned in spatial_setup, action_beats, dialogue_beats, ending_beat, closing_blocking, or video_prompt must appear in subjects_on_screen. Do not mention a bystander in blocking while omitting that person from the visible cast.
- NAMED CAST IS CLOSED: subjects_on_screen may contain only named people present in the user concept, supplied character references, binding voice bible, or locked screenplay dialogue. Setting-appropriate silent extras may appear only as generic roles such as "barista" or "background patron". Never add a named cameo or another familiar character from the franchise.
- A shot may follow another in the finished edit, but its prompt must describe its own opening state instead of saying "continue", "as before", "the push-in continues", or similar.
- multishot is always false because this is not the LTX Multi-Shot LoRA format. That field does NOT prohibit H3 from making speaker-motivated internal cuts, reframes, and reaction coverage inside its one bounded generation.

BINDING CAUSAL STORY BLUEPRINT:
{story_blueprint_text}

The screenplay is the final performed story, and the blueprint is its causal
continuity ledger. Preserve the screenplay's exact events and dialogue while
using the blueprint to keep objectives, locations, consequences, relationship
changes, physical damage, and props connected across scene boundaries. Do not
add a location or incident merely for shot variety.

IMMUTABLE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE MANIFEST:
{dialogue_manifest_json}

The manifest is authoritative. Emit every listed turn exactly once, in that
order, with the same speaker_name represented by dialogue_beats[].speaker_id
and a matching visible subjects_on_screen entry. Do not add dialogue. An empty
manifest means every shot is silent.

Repeat the relevant show/movie/franchise and exact physical location from that source of truth in every shot's environment AND video_prompt. Character names alone are not enough. Only the action/dialogue assigned to that one shot may occur in its prompt.

Continuity audit before responding:
1. Assign one stable full wardrobe to each character for each continuity_group and repeat it in every appearance.
2. Compare every shot's closing_blocking with the next shot's spatial_setup.
3. If the same-scene positions differ, put the required movement in the earlier shot's action_beats and video_prompt so the next opening is earned on screen.
4. Use extend_previous only for a literal seamless continuation with unchanged camera composition. Use continuous for ordinary same-scene cuts.
5. Cross-check every dialogue_beats entry against video_prompt. Copy each spoken_text verbatim into one <d>[language] ...</d> tag using that beat's actual spoken language. Never translate a line. For a silent shot, forbid invented speech and gibberish explicitly.
6. At every continuity_group change, verify that the prior ending visibly motivates the new location/time and that the new opening shows the resulting arrival or consequence. "Independent" is a render boundary, not a story reset.
7. Compare persistent state across that boundary: objective, knowledge, relationship, injuries, wardrobe damage, and important props must carry forward unless the screenplay visibly changes them.
8. Remove any unrelated incident, antagonist, or location that is not supported by the screenplay and story blueprint.
9. Fill story_scene_number, causal_handoff, and persistent_story_state for every shot. Verify that scene numbers are monotonic and that adjacent handoffs describe one cause-and-effect chain rather than summaries of unrelated events.

H3 WHOLE-PLAN REPAIR - YOUR PREVIOUS PLAN WAS REJECTED:
{issue_lines}

Rewrite the COMPLETE plan from the screenplay, including its ending. The
immutable dialogue manifest above must appear exactly once, in order, with
each line kept in the visual shot whose action and visible speaker match it.
You may use {shot_count_low}-{repair_max_items} shots. Increase a shot only up
to {maximum_seconds:.2f}s or use additional self-contained shots. Never return
a partial array, truncate a line, move dialogue to an unrelated visual beat,
nest <d> tags, or exceed {DIALOGUE_MAX_WORDS_PER_SECOND:g} spoken words per second in any shot.
Aim for {DIALOGUE_DEFAULT_WORDS_PER_SECOND:g} words per second during speech when timing permits.

Keep structured metadata concise so the complete array fits: one short
sentence per descriptive metadata field and at most three action beats. Put
the complete standalone generation description in video_prompt instead of
repeating that prose across every metadata field."""
