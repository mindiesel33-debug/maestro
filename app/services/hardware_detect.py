"""
Hardware detection for the Performance Auto-Tune feature.

Single entry point: `detect_hardware()` returns a dict describing the
user's GPU + RAM + which acceleration kernels are actually installed.
The recommendation engine in `perf_recommend.py` consumes this and
returns the settings to apply.

Design notes:
- All heavy imports (torch, pynvml) are wrapped in try/except so this
  module loads cleanly on systems without CUDA — the AMD/CPU fallback
  path returns a minimal dict with `cuda_available=False`.
- Detection is deliberately cheap: no model loads, no kernel init.
  Should run in <100ms on any system. Safe to call from a sync HTTP
  endpoint without spawning a thread.
- Capability detection (sm89, sm120, sage, etc.) is conservative —
  we check both GPU capability AND that the relevant kernel module
  imports cleanly. A user with an RTX 4090 but no FP8 kernels
  installed will report `supports_fp8=False`, because we can't
  actually use FP8 in that state.
