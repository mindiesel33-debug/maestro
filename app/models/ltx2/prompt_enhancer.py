"""Scenema Audio prompt-enhancer prompts (and ID-LoRA talking-video).

The two big Scenema enhancer prompts (single-speaker monologue, and
two-speaker dialogue) are loaded from markdown guides under
`services/llm_guides/prompt_enhancer/` via the shared loader. This
keeps the prompt content editable as plain markdown — anyone can
tune phrasing or add examples without touching Python — and makes
the same guides reusable by Director Mode later (the screenplay
LLM's system prompt can `load_guide("prompt_enhancer", "scenema_dialogue_rules")`
when Scenema is the per-shot audio engine).

The module-level `SCENEMA_SPEECH_PROMPT` / `SCENEMA_DIALOGUE_PROMPT`
names are preserved so `scenema_audio_handler.py` (and any other
caller) keeps working with no import change. They evaluate lazily
via a small proxy so the markdown read happens on first attribute
access, not at import time — keeps cold-start cheap and avoids a
hard dependency on the file existing during initial module load.
