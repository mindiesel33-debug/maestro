## Wan2GP v12.71 media and H3 integrations

The VDN attention implementation, H3 dialogue Whisper boundary alignment,
DLSS native-worker adapter, offload registry, and optional DLSS installer are adapted from **deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP**, commit
`1e1dd2757f24923f008593d9d4ec09062234be20` (5 September 2026).
H3 grouped mask conditioning, outpaint margin quantization, audio refinement,
audio-only generation, and RIFE temporal interpolation also incorporate work
from this revision. Maestro-specific queue, API, and React integration is local.

The upstream WanGP Community License 2.0 covering these contributions is
preserved in `app/LICENSES/WanGP-Community-2.0.txt`. This notice does not replace
licenses applicable to older Maestro components or model weights.

- VDN weights: https://huggingface.co/DeepBeepMeep/MiniMax-H3/tree/304d34f7751f8ba9ca0eb55d5d10044234cdbfe2
- Native worker source and licenses: https://github.com/DeepBeepMeep/dlss5-visual-enhancer

Native DLSS binaries are not distributed in this repository. The optional
installer preserves their bundled notices and verifies pinned checksums.
The neural-rendering runtime includes community-modified, unsigned
NVIDIA-derived components outside the official NVIDIA SDK distribution.
See `docs/DLSS5.md` for installation requirements and the explicit installer
acknowledgment. NVIDIA, ReShade, RenoDX and model licenses remain applicable
to their respective files.

## Viggle Animate

Maestro's Viggle conditioning and integration adapt **deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP**
v12.72, commit `057f9ecab9ad57dfbec9768b2daf7a4426ce986c`, under the WanGP
Community License 2.0 preserved at `app/LICENSES/WanGP-Community-2.0.txt`.
This includes fixed-prompt reference ordering, control-window slicing and the
rank-8 affine compatibility map. Model assets are downloaded on demand from
`DeepBeepMeep/MiniMax-H3`, revision `fa7ed035f21d341439d4dd763a020fc4a2482c43`.
The dedicated Viggle weights retain their upstream MiniMax H3 Community model
terms; they are not bundled in Maestro.

## H3 Face Refiner

Maestro's H3 Face Refiner also adapts the face detection, identity tracking,
crop preparation, stitch-back and refinement schedule from Wan2GP commit
`1e1dd2757f24923f008593d9d4ec09062234be20`. The face module is derived from
**Carasibana/ComfyUI-H3-FaceRefine** commit
`79a97ce5ee4b393ce26313bd1280b706fe8b4f2c`; its MIT license is preserved at
`app/postprocessing/h3_face_refiner/LICENSE.upstream`. WanGP's adaptation is
covered by the WanGP Community License noted above. Ultralytics is an external
AGPL-3.0 dependency. InsightFace model weights and H3/LightX2V weights retain
their respective upstream model terms; model weights are downloaded on demand.

## MiniMax H3 Sol Engine

Maestro's optional H3 Sol Engine includes adapted Apache-2.0-licensed source
from the following projects:

- **NVlabs/Sana Sol-Attn**, pinned to commit
  `46031940ba8af5d18054217e571149579424c0b1`.
  Source: https://github.com/NVlabs/Sana/tree/46031940ba8af5d18054217e571149579424c0b1/techniques/sparse_backends/sol_attn
- **Saganaki22/ComfyUI-sol-attn**, pinned to release `v0.5.2` / commit
  `e2fc225` for the optimized INT8-QK path.
  Source: https://github.com/Saganaki22/ComfyUI-sol-attn/tree/e2fc225

The applicable Apache License 2.0 text is distributed at
`app/shared/sol_attn/saganaki/LICENSE`. Adapted source files retain SPDX
license identifiers and upstream attribution.

## MiniMax H3 SLA sparse attention

Maestro's optional H3 SLA backend adapts MIT-licensed implementation work
from **PlagueKind/ComfyUI-PlagueKind-Nodes-only-sparse**, pinned to commit
`fd26ffb89dee294ca740a59632e5b3423b9a9d2a`. That implementation adapts
Apache-2.0-licensed SLA utilities and kernels from **ModelTC/LightX2V**.

- Source: https://github.com/ethanfel/ComfyUI-PlagueKind-Nodes-only-sparse/tree/fd26ffb89dee294ca740a59632e5b3423b9a9d2a
- LightX2V source: https://github.com/ModelTC/LightX2V
- The MIT license text is distributed at
  `app/models/minimax_h3/SLA_LICENSE.txt`.
- The Apache License 2.0 text covering the adapted LightX2V portions is
  distributed at `app/shared/sol_attn/saganaki/LICENSE`.

## Experimental Windows 10 direct DLSS backend

The optional Windows 10 integration calls the native ABI of **lisitskyaa/ComfyUI-DLSS5-NR**
v0.3.1, pinned to commit `41dcdfa593cb61b6a98c65bb8ed27606260bb598`.
Its MIT-licensed bridge/caller libraries are obtained by an explicit installer;
they are not bundled in Maestro's source. Maestro's worker follows its native
parameter and channel-order contracts, with separate process isolation.

- Source: https://github.com/lisitskyaa/ComfyUI-DLSS5-NR/tree/41dcdfa593cb61b6a98c65bb8ed27606260bb598
- MIT text: `app/LICENSES/ComfyUI-DLSS5-NR-MIT.txt`.
- Upstream third-party notices, including NIGos optical-flow attribution:
  `app/LICENSES/ComfyUI-DLSS5-NR-THIRD-PARTY.md`.
- `app/scripts/install_dlss5_direct.py` pins package and extracted-file hashes.

The separate SR worker comes from the same WanGP DLSS worker release already
used by the Windows 11 integration. Its included DLSS5-Feeder license is
installed alongside it. NVIDIA-derived SR and modified unsigned NR runtime
binaries retain their own terms; the bridge's MIT license grants no rights in
NVIDIA software. Driver NGX and optical-flow libraries are loaded from the
installed driver and are not redistributed. See `docs/DLSS5.md` for the explicit
opt-in and experimental limitations.

The explicit installer obtains the NVIDIA-derived runtime assets from these
community-hosted **RankFTW/rhi-repo** release archives:

- Modified NR: [dlssnr-310.8.SF-v2](https://github.com/RankFTW/rhi-repo/releases/download/dlssnr-310.8.SF-v2/nvngx_dlssnr_310.8.SF-v2.zip).
  Archive SHA-256: `1da35941894994eb087e017577829e492454e9bae3a6a9397027069ceb74955c`.
- SR: [dlss-310.8.0](https://github.com/RankFTW/rhi-repo/releases/download/dlss-310.8.0/nvngx_dlss_310.8.0.zip).
  Archive SHA-256: `fb481660f7e952b87f91760e3afd7f9dc14cd2c3361b470e948d6346e4323009`.

These pinned archives contain no separate license or notice file. They are
runtime downloads, not source assets redistributed in Maestro; neither this
attribution nor the bridge's MIT license grants a license to NVIDIA software.

## Tiny VAE generation previews

The optional generation-preview integration adapts Wan2GP's live previews,
contributed by **GOvEy1nw**, from revision
`b8b18f8114e432eea8f3d7e853a51dd91fa99571`.

- Upstream preview integration: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP/tree/b8b18f8114e432eea8f3d7e853a51dd91fa99571
- **madebyollin/taesd** and **madebyollin/taehv** decoder implementations retain
  their MIT licenses in `app/shared/tinyvae/LICENSES/taesd-MIT.txt` and
  `app/shared/tinyvae/LICENSES/taehv-MIT.txt`.
- The H3 approximate decoder's Apache-2.0 license text is distributed in
  `app/shared/tinyvae/LICENSES/taeh3-Apache-2.0.txt`; its pinned weight source is
  **Kijai/MiniMax-H3-TAE**.
- Decoder weight download identities and SHA-256 values are recorded in
  `app/shared/tinyvae/decoders.json`; revision-pinned upstream reference sources
  are recorded in `app/shared/tinyvae/sources.json`.

Decoder weights download on demand and are not redistributed in this source
repository. Their source/model terms remain separate from Maestro's application
license. See `docs/Generation-preview.md` for support and behavior.

## DaSiWa and imported community checkpoints

DaSiWa checkpoints are user-selected imports rather than built-in model
selections. No checkpoint weights are redistributed. Official source links
and family import limits are documented in `docs/DaSiWa-models.md`.
Imported CivitAI H3 files retain
creator/source provenance and verification receipts. Underlying model licenses
and creator distribution terms continue to apply; Maestro's application license
does not grant rights in these weights. See `docs/H3-checkpoint-import.md`.

## MATLOWAI MiniMax H3 fused four-step checkpoint

The optional experimental model definitions
`minimax_h3_fused_turbo` and `minimax_h3_ref2va_fused_turbo` download the
same revision-pinned community checkpoint from
**MATLOWAI/minimax-h3-fused-turbo-int8-convrot**. It combines MiniMax H3,
the xmarre Ref2VA delta approximation, LightX2V Turbo, Mystic, and ConvRot
conversion components. No model weights are redistributed in this source
repository.

The matching experimental INT8 ConvRot video VAE is downloaded separately
from **Kijai/MiniMax-H3-experimental**. It is pinned to revision
`a3e7d8da4ae7ba8df0779094cf5ab9d6ee855fe4`, with expected SHA-256
`9bb2d96f218c76babd85e0611b85ca8fb330a90546c01a0005e8a58a59593410`.

Users must review the linked model license and NOTICE before downloading or
using this optional checkpoint; its terms and geographic scope differ from
Maestro's application license.
