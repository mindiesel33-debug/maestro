# Maestro v2.1.0 local release validation

Prepared on 7 September 2026 and finalized on 8 September before publication.
This record documents local validation of the release candidate. See the
[release notes](RELEASE_NOTES_V2.1.0.md) for the user-facing changes.

Final staging completed on 8 September with the dialogue, shared-guide,
Studio/Director controls and mobile gallery follow-ups below.

## Release boundary

- Public `dev` and `main` were rechecked before publication on 8 September against
  GitHub with read-only `git ls-remote`. Both pointed to
  `a5dddd4faa53e8fa8d76ef528c1074935eded8c0`, whose
  application `VERSION` is `2.0.1`.
- The feature work before release preparation ended at `a48da84`, 15 commits
  after that public baseline. Release notes cover that complete difference and
  the cleanup performed during this release check.
- The final application checkpoint is `310d1a9`, 24 commits after the public
  baseline. Staging reconciles the final documentation after that checkpoint.
- Root `VERSION` is now `2.1.0`. The isolated application version reader returns
  `2.1.0`; README, changelog and release notes agree. Pinokio's launcher schema
  version and the private frontend package version are separate values.
- The production UI was rebuilt locally. Build output remains ignored; normal
  installation/update builds it from source.
- The running backend was not restarted during staging. Its read-only
  system-config endpoint now reports `2.1.0`, matching the source version and
  rendered Maestro branding. Active projects and jobs were not reset or replaced.
- No push, remote branch update, release tag, or GitHub release was performed
  during local staging. The maintainer approved publication to `dev` and `main`
  on 8 September after reviewing the candidate.

## Final staging checks — 8 September

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Complete Python unittest discovery | 1,426 tests run: 1,425 passed and one CUDA-only test skipped, in 82.325 seconds. |
| Standalone JSON grammar runner | All five checks passed. |
| Python syntax | First-party services, launch/runtime entry points, H3, Wan T5, DLSS, Face Refiner, RIFE and release scripts compiled successfully. |
| Production UI build and ESLint | Both passed; existing bundle-size/dynamic-import warnings remain. |
| Full Studio/Director browser suite | Passed, including six theme variants and 1360/767/440/390/320px widths. |
| Five focused UI/settings suites | Duration, character images, Viggle preparation, LoRA URL import and fused-H3 LoRA restoration all passed. |
| Release version | `VERSION`, isolated application reader and running backend all report `2.1.0`. |
| Source boundary and documentation | Clean-repo guard passed for 2,181 tracked files; all 38 local links in release/navigation documentation resolve; diff whitespace passed. |
| Public references at staging | Both branches pointed to the v2.0.1 baseline; no public `v2.1.0` tag existed. |

The complete browser run includes the latest Advanced section badges,
viewport-bounded guides, Director Auto controls, H3 LoRA weights and intercepted
queue payloads. The final mobile gallery header was separately inspected at
320/390/440/767px: centered full branding, no repeated mode selector, retained
sidecar mode controls and unchanged desktop navigation.

Tests used the existing CPU validation environment and isolated browser origins
with mocked writes/generation. No live generation, LLM call, install, reset or
backend restart was performed. The manual hardware/device limits below remain.
Configuration and launcher files are unchanged since their initial syntax checks.

Final logs use the `.codex-tmp/v2.1.0-staging-` prefix: `unittest.log`,
`grammar.log`, `build.log`, `lint.log`, `sidebar.log`, `duration.log`,
`characters.log`, `viggle.log`, `lora-import.log` and `lora-restore.log`.
The local source archive and checksum are kept outside Git under
`.codex-tmp/releases/v2.1.0/`; the staging archive corresponds to commit `99a8e3d`.

## Publication CI follow-up — 8 September

The first `dev` CI run passed the source guard, syntax check and production UI
build, but its isolated Python environment lacked FastAPI and SoundFile. That
caused two character test modules to fail import and three long-audio tests to
error. CI now installs pinned FastAPI, Pydantic, HTTPX, multipart-upload and
SoundFile dependencies for those routes and audio fixtures. Application code
and the running installation are unchanged by this CI-only correction. Workflow
YAML parsing and all 49 tests in the affected character-recovery, RefMod and
long-audio modules passed locally after the correction.

## Initial candidate checks — 7 September

The Python run used the existing Python 3.11.13 environment with
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1`. Browser checks used Chromium with isolated test
origins and intercepted writes/generation requests; they did not run GPU jobs.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Full Python unittest discovery | 1,408 tests run: 1,407 passed and one CUDA-only test skipped, in 64.048 seconds. |
| Standalone JSON grammar regressions | All five checks passed. |
| Python compile check | Passed for application services, launch/runtime entry points, H3, Wan T5, DLSS, Face Refiner, RIFE and release scripts. |
| Frontend ESLint | Passed. |
| Production TypeScript/Vite build | Passed. Existing bundle-size and dynamic-import warnings remain. |
| Studio/Director browser suite | Passed; includes six theme variants and widths of 1360, 767, 440, 390 and 320 pixels. |
| Character, Viggle, LoRA and duration browser suites | All five additional suites passed. |
| JSON/configuration parsing | 348 strict JSON files and two TypeScript JSONC configurations passed. |
| JavaScript syntax | 28 complete scripts plus the assembled built-in Gradio script passed; none of the launchers were executed by this check. |
| PowerShell syntax | Both tracked scripts passed parsing; neither installer/helper was executed. |
| Repository boundary and release hygiene | Clean-repository guard, release documentation links and diff whitespace checks passed. User data, environments, downloaded models, runtime binaries and build artifacts remain outside the commit. |

The one skipped test is
`test_triton_temporal_convolution_matches_torch` in `test_h3_wan_port.py`.
It requires CUDA and was intentionally skipped in this CPU validation run.

The browser coverage includes prompt stability during typing and polling,
mobile keyboard viewport simulation, Animate-to-Image editing, Director
horizontal bounds, all resolution/aspect choices, duration convergence and
slider stability, character ordering/recovery, held queue payloads, saved
settings, enhancement review, direct Recipes/Browser actions and the H3 Extend
full-model transition.

The final unittest and sidebar logs are retained locally as
`.codex-tmp/v2.1.0-unittest-final.log` and
`.codex-tmp/v2.1.0-sidebar-ui.log`; the grammar log is
`.codex-tmp/v2.1.0-grammar.log`. Browser screenshots are under
`.codex-tmp/sidebar-validation/`. These artifacts are intentionally not shipped.

## Cleanup prompted by these checks

- ETA-history SQLite connections now close after their transactions, resolving
  Windows file locks without changing the commit/rollback behavior.
- Wan/SCAIL's T5 encoder no longer selects CUDA at module import. An omitted
  device is resolved when constructing the encoder, with a CPU fallback.
- Shared Media Flow helpers were moved out of React component modules.
  Capability refreshes discard stale responses after unmount or a newer request.
- Existing source-contract assertions were updated for the intentional Studio
  redesign, the Viggle affine asset and retained Music3 defaults migration.
  The obsolete automatic prompt-growth assertion now reflects the fixed Studio
  composer; browser tests separately exercise its actual size and scrolling.
- Feature guides now use the current Characters, Duration and Advanced locations.
  The README no longer labels post-public features as part of v2.0.1.

## Creative dialogue follow-up — 8 September

- Replaced stale dialogue examples with duration-specific writing targets using
  the shared 2.8 words/second speech pace and 3 words/second maximum. Targets
  account for action, pauses, brief exchanges and explicit silence.
- Corrected Creative's quoted-line contract, speech detection, and complete-script
  timing guidance. Raised H3's two-turn planning cap to six turns per window.
  Added bounded retries for sparse dialogue in single prompts and H3 sequences;
  sequence retries retain source events, exact lines, and speaker ownership.
- Full CPU-only Python discovery: **1,423 tests run; 1,422 passed, one CUDA-only
  test skipped**, in 64.184 seconds. Log:
  `.codex-tmp/creative-dialogue-full-suite-final.log`.
- Added 15 neutral-content regression tests, including the real enhancement
  pipeline with mocked LLM transport, per-window word counts, exact quote/event
  ownership, unknown speakers, silence, and failure recovery. The focused H3 and
  dialogue selection contains 101 tests. After a final fallback-message wording
  correction, all 101 passed again. The five standalone JSON-grammar checks also passed.
- No frontend or launcher behavior changed in this follow-up. The earlier UI
  build/browser checks remain the applicable evidence. No live LLM authoring,
  GPU media generation, application restart, or public push was performed.
- Before release, review actual AI Creative outputs with the selected local LLM:
  a 14.4-second tutorial, a conversation over several H3 windows, and an action
  scene requesting brief dialogue. Mocked transport verifies scheduling and
  preservation; it does not establish every model's writing or rendered quality.

## Shared H3 content guide follow-up — 8 September

- Replaced H3's separate inline Mature-mode note with conditional loading of
  Studio's existing `enhance/nsfw_shared.md`. Both planning styles use it for
  story treatment, chapter planning, segment expansion and bounded retries.
  The guide's wording and the server-side eligibility checks are unchanged.
- Bumped the shared H3 planner version so old plans are invalidated. JSON output
  contracts, timing rules and reference constraints remain in the stage guides.
- **143 focused tests passed**: 104 shared-guide, Frames planner, story ledger
  and dialogue tests, plus 39 Reference sequence and prompt-budget tests. Logs:
  `.codex-tmp/h3-shared-guide-tests.log` and
  `.codex-tmp/h3-shared-guide-sequence-tests.log`.
- Three new tests and an updated Frames regression use neutral guide markers
  and mocked LLM calls to check on/off routing, both styles, long-form chapters,
  retries, empty-guide behavior and switching Mature mode off in the same
  process. No explicit-content authoring or live model quality testing was done.
- No frontend or launcher changes, application restart, or public push.
  Restart Maestro to load the backend change; restart again after editing a
  guide because guide text is cached. Re-enhance prompts to apply the change.

## Studio scrolling follow-up — 8 September

- Studio's media tabs, workflow selector, inputs and prompt now share one
  vertical scroller above the fixed settings and generation controls. The main
  prompt uses a hidden text mirror for intrinsic sizing, grows/shrinks with its
  contents, and retains its mounted editor and selection. Long scripts have no
  inner scrollbar. Caret-line tracking keeps typing visible on keyboard changes.
- Production TypeScript/Vite build and ESLint passed. The existing bundle-size
  and dynamic-import warnings remain. Build output is local and ignored.
- All **14 selected Python source regressions passed**. The full isolated
  sidebar browser suite passed, including six theme variants, duration/menu
  behavior, H3 prompt review, explicit enhancement, held queues and Director.
- New browser coverage exercises Frames, References, Image and Speech at
  1280x520, 1000x420, 390x844 and 320x568 with expanded hardware status. Real
  mouse-wheel input over the textarea moves the shared scroller while settings
  and Generate stay fixed. Long scripts grow, short scripts shrink, mode
  controls and enhancement tools remain reachable, and polling or simulated
  writing-extension overlays do not change the text layout.
- Updated mobile keyboard tests check the active caret near the end of a long
  Animate-to-Image prompt as viewport height/offset changes. The 390px and
  320px simulations also retain the return action and Animate appearance input.
  These Chromium checks do not replace a real iPhone/Safari keyboard pass.
- Logs: `.codex-tmp/composer-scroll-build.log`,
  `.codex-tmp/composer-scroll-lint.log`,
  `.codex-tmp/composer-scroll-source-tests.log`,
  `.codex-tmp/composer-scroll-ui.log` and
  `.codex-tmp/composer-scroll-full-ui.log`. Screenshots remain under
  `.codex-tmp/sidebar-validation/`. No backend restart, live generation,
  launcher changes or public push was performed. Refresh the browser to use
  the rebuilt UI.

## Clip settings follow-up — 8 September

- Resolution and Aspect menus now size to their option labels and open directly
  above their indicators, within the sidebar. All model-provided choices remain.
- Studio video duration now has Time/Window tabs with an Auto toggle. Auto dims
  and disables manual time controls; Time retains the model-step slider through
  five minutes and the 10m, 15m, 30m, 60m and Custom choices. Window Length stays
  visible with automatic sizing, GPU recommendations and manual overrides.
  Window overlap is collapsed by default in both tabs. The popup keeps a steady
  height while sliders move and scrolls internally when extra controls need room.
- Production TypeScript/Vite build and ESLint passed. The focused clip-settings
  browser checks and the full isolated sidebar suite passed at desktop/mobile
  widths and across all six themes. Checks cover menu size/alignment, Auto's
  disabled controls, stable slider position, overlap editing, Window mode,
  continuity, enhancement actions, queues and the existing shared scroller.
- The duration/state integration suite passed, including native increments,
  GPU caps, manual 14.4-second windows, 60-minute output, Extend restoration and
  Viggle source-duration planning. Existing duration calculations were retained.
- A simulated keyboard transition exposed stale popup positioning; measuring
  after the drawer's layout update and observing its size corrected it. The
  final keyboard viewport checks passed. These Chromium simulations still need
  the normal real iPhone/Safari check during user testing.
- Logs: `.codex-tmp/clip-settings-build.log`,
  `.codex-tmp/clip-settings-lint.log`, `.codex-tmp/clip-settings-ui.log`,
  `.codex-tmp/clip-settings-full-ui.log` and
  `.codex-tmp/clip-settings-duration-math.log`. Menu and Auto screenshots are in
  `.codex-tmp/sidebar-validation/`. No live generation, backend restart,
  launcher change or public push was performed. Refresh to use the rebuilt UI.

## Auto interaction follow-up — 8 September

- Auto and the current duration now stay visible above both Time and Window,
  preserving the tabs' vertical position. Enabling Auto from Window returns
  to the automatic Time recommendation.
- Auto's manual time controls remain dimmed but interactive. Grabbing the
  slider turns Auto off on pointer-down, and the same drag sets the duration.
  Keyboard adjustment, preset selection and custom time entry also take over
  directly. Model limits and genuinely unavailable controls stay enforced.
- Production TypeScript/Vite build and ESLint passed. The focused isolated
  clip-settings browser suite passed at 1360, 767, 440, 390 and 320 pixels,
  checking immediate activation, preserved drag position, keyboard native
  increments, preset/custom values, stable tabs and Auto from Window. Existing
  overlap, window sizing, continuation and keyboard viewport checks also passed.
- The duration/state integration suite passed, including GPU recommendations,
  manual 14.4-second limits, 60-minute presets, Extend and Viggle restoration.
  Logs: `.codex-tmp/auto-duration-build.log`,
  `.codex-tmp/auto-duration-lint.log`, `.codex-tmp/auto-duration-ui.log` and
  `.codex-tmp/auto-duration-state.log`. Browser actions used intercepted writes;
  no live generation, backend restart, launcher changes or public push occurred.
  Refresh Maestro to load the rebuilt UI.

## Advanced and LoRA guide follow-up — 8 September

- Advanced's section headings now share active-setting groups with the total
  badge. Nonzero counts appear in small circular badges, even when sections are
  collapsed. The video window override belongs to Duration and is no longer
  counted in Advanced; unavailable adapter/finishing controls do not add badges.
- Advanced uses its actual button as an anchor on mobile and desktop, stays
  within the sidebar and opens above the generation controls. Expanded settings
  remain scrollable and unfinished preset drafts stay mounted.
- The shared Studio/Director LoRA guide uses explicit viewport-bounded
  positioning, with scrolling for long text and room above or below its button.
  Pointer, focus, tap, outside-click and Escape handling retain the parent
  settings panel. Studio's guide button is now a sibling of the adapter toggle
  instead of an invalid nested button.
- Production TypeScript/Vite build and ESLint passed. The focused isolated
  browser checks passed at 1360, 767, 440, 390 and 320 pixels, covering live badge
  updates, totals, zero-state hiding, popup bounds, guide scrolling, unchanged
  LoRA selection, nested dismissal and a simulated keyboard viewport.
- The full sidebar browser suite passed, including all six themes, collapsed
  and expanded Advanced panels, prompt stability and scrolling, duration,
  character settings, explicit enhancement, held queues and Director layout.
  These Chromium checks do not replace real iPhone/Safari testing.
- Logs: `.codex-tmp/advanced-popups-build.log`,
  `.codex-tmp/advanced-popups-lint.log`, `.codex-tmp/advanced-popups-ui.log` and
  `.codex-tmp/advanced-popups-full-ui.log`. Screenshots are under
  `.codex-tmp/sidebar-validation/`, including `advanced-badges-390.png` and
  `lora-guide-390.png`. Tests used neutral LoRA fixtures and intercepted writes;
  no live generation, backend restart, launcher changes or public push occurred.

## Director duration and LoRA follow-up — 8 September

- Director's Target Duration now opts into Studio's shared compact control:
  persistent Auto/current-duration header, Time/Window tabs, direct takeover
  from the dimmed slider/presets, and the reduced long-preset list. Director's
  existing minimum duration and model/GPU planning rules remain in place.
- Read-only LoRA metadata confirmed H3 reports zero guidance phases, while
  Flux 2 Klein reports one and LTX reports two. Director now gives H3 one
  editable strength, repairs empty stored arrays from saved multipliers, and
  preserves each phase on multi-phase models. Loading recommendations no
  longer changes a saved 1.0 strength. Mobile numeric fields show full values.
- Production TypeScript/Vite build and ESLint passed. The isolated Director
  settings/layout checks passed at 1360, 390 and 320 pixels, including native
  time steps, Auto pointer takeover, long presets, custom timecodes, Window
  counts, H3 zero/1.0 strengths, legacy recovery, multi-phase weights, Image
  isolation, browser persistence, scrolling and simulated keyboard geometry.
- An intercepted Director queue request retained the reviewed 85-second
  target, H3 Video weight 0.45 and independent Image weight 2.0. All browser
  mutations were intercepted; no live plan, generation or project was created.
- Logs: `.codex-tmp/director-settings-build.log`,
  `.codex-tmp/director-settings-lint.log` and
  `.codex-tmp/director-settings-ui.log`. The mobile screenshot is
  `.codex-tmp/sidebar-validation/director-lora-390.png`. No backend restart,
  launcher changes or public push occurred. Real iPhone testing remains a
  device check; Chromium viewport simulation is the evidence recorded here.

## Prior model checks and remaining manual validation

The [H3/media port record](development/wan2gp-12-71-port-plan.md) records earlier
RTX 4090 queue tests for Full/Pruned VDN, 45-second and five-minute H3 audio,
audio-refinement video preservation, H3 outpainting and RIFE x3. Those checks
are historical evidence, not GPU runs repeated during this release preparation.

The following remain manual checks before describing the release as fully
validated across supported hardware:

- Fresh installation and an update from an existing public v2.0.1 installation.
  No reset, reinstall or dependency replacement was performed on the active
  development installation for this candidate.
- A final real iPhone/Safari keyboard and scrolling pass. Chromium viewport
  simulation passed; it does not reproduce every iOS keyboard animation.
- Native DLSS Neural Rendering and Frame Generation on supported Windows 11/RTX
  hardware. This Windows 10 machine cannot execute that path; synthetic worker,
  capability, transport and cancellation tests do not establish its image
  quality or performance. The optional installer was not run.
- Representative long/high-resolution VDN and multi-character/face-refinement
  quality checks for the intended hardware. No fixed speed improvement is
  claimed from this release validation.

The maintainer approved publication to `dev` and `main` on 8 September 2026.
The local maintainer checklist records publication progress; GitHub Actions
records branch validation. The remaining manual checks above are separate from
the completed local automated checks.
