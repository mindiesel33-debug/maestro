# Studio controls

On mobile, the gallery header centers the Maestro icon, name and version.
The sidecar menu stays on the left, with Queue and Settings on the right.
Open the sidecar to switch between Director, Studio and Editor.

Choose Video, Image or Audio and a workflow at the top of Studio. The complete workflow list opens over the editor. The media tabs, workflow selector, references and prompt share one vertically scrollable area. Short prompts fill the available writing space; long prompts expand with their text. Choose the model beside Generate at the bottom. The app header, settings strip, generation controls and hardware status stay outside this scroller.

The fixed settings strip keeps Characters on the left and groups Recipes, Resolution, Aspect, Duration and Advanced together on the right, with Recipes immediately beside Resolution. Advanced becomes an icon with its active count when the sidebar is narrow, and the output indicators keep their values without decorative icons. In the smallest layouts, Characters also uses its icon so the controls remain separate and tappable. Indicators show the current choices; Auto duration shows its recommended length below a small Auto label and updates as the recommendation changes. The Auto toggle's tooltip also previews the recommendation before enabling it. Resolution and Aspect open lists sized to their labels, directly above the clicked button on desktop and mobile, without redundant headings. Selecting a value closes its list; keyboard users can use the arrow keys, Home/End and Escape. The options still come from the selected model, including Auto and model-specific tiers. Duration and Advanced retain their detailed overlays. Opening a setting does not resize the prompt or move Generate. Click another indicator to switch panels or click outside to dismiss.

Video Duration has **Time** and **Window** tabs. The **Auto** toggle and current duration stay visible above both tabs. Enabling Auto from either view returns to Time and follows the automatic recommendation. The time slider, presets and custom time entry appear dimmed but remain interactive: grabbing the slider, adjusting it with arrow keys, choosing a preset or editing the timecode turns Auto off immediately. You can also turn Auto off explicitly. **Time keeps the total runtime fixed** when you change Window Length and recalculates how many passes are needed. It uses the model-aligned slider through five minutes, or **10m, 15m, 30m, 60m or Custom** where supported. **Window keeps the selected window count fixed** and updates total duration as Window Length changes: one 10.1s window becomes one 14.4s window. Multiple continuation windows account for overlap and discarded frames; independent hard-cut clips use their full lengths. Window retains its exact count presets, slider and number field. A note below Window Length explains which duration behavior is active. Auto continues following the prompt or source media. Adjustable **Window Length** stays visible and automatically follows shorter Time durations up to the GPU recommendation or saved/manual limit. Automatic sizing continues while the popup is closed. Window overrides and saved GPU/model preferences work as before. **Window overlap** starts collapsed in both tabs and opens when needed; unsupported overlap controls remain hidden. H3 Reference sequences keep their **Carry motion and sound between windows** option here. Speech and Director retain their specialized duration controls.

For H3 **Frames** and **References**, open Duration and enable **Allow 30s clips · Experimental** below the window assessment. This sets the manual window limit to 30s. **Window keeps its selected count** when you enable or disable the experiment, and total duration follows the selected window length throughout the extended range. **Time keeps its target runtime**. Choose **Time → Custom → 00:00:30**, or **Window → 1**, for one pass without continuation windows. H3's frame spacing makes this 719 frames (29.96s at 24 fps). You can lower Window Length to experiment with shorter passes. Longer timelines can still use multiple extended windows. Selecting Auto exits the experiment and restores GPU-based sizing. This exceeds the model's published 15s duration: it needs more VRAM and time, and motion or identity may drift. The setting travels with queued jobs and output settings; Animate's fixed motion-transfer windows and audio-reference limits are unchanged.

On mobile, settings overlays fit within the sidebar. Video Duration opens directly above its button with a compact, steady height while values change. Additional controls scroll inside it. Sequence details sit below the sliders, so switching between one window and a longer sequence does not move the slider you are adjusting. The panel follows its button when the keyboard or available screen size changes. Close it with Escape, its indicator, or a click outside.

Image generation includes **21:9** ultrawide alongside the other aspect ratios. Choosing a fixed aspect while Resolution is **Auto** selects **720p** so the generated image uses that shape; you can then choose another resolution tier.

H3 **Window Length** shows a live speed-path estimate and a separate GPU memory assessment. The estimate includes the selected resolution, reference media and carried history, and describes the largest pass actually needed by the timeline. A 30-second window limit with a shorter timeline is assessed at the shorter generated length. **Faster path expected** means the estimated workload fits the native normalization path; **Slower path expected** means it requires bounded normalization chunks. Neither label promises an overall render time. Expand **Why this estimate?** for estimated packed rows and uncertainty. Memory guidance uses the selected checkpoint's existing VRAM profile, so the recommended window can change across GPUs and resolutions. References can require additional headroom.

Enable **Allow 30s clips · Experimental** to move Window Length through the full 30-second range. The duration band marks H3's recommended **14.4s** limit, and any larger selected limit shows a warning. Longer passes can be much slower, run out of memory, or drift in quality; use shorter consecutive windows when possible. The UI does not assign a universal slowdown multiplier or treat 75,000 rows as a VRAM limit. **Auto** exits the experiment and restores the GPU-aware recommendation.

## Krea 2 Identity Edit

Krea 2 RAW and Turbo Identity Edit expose three controls in **Advanced → Generation**:

- **Subject likeness** controls reference fidelity from 0 to 10. The default, 1, keeps the original behavior; **Strong likeness · 4** is a useful starting point for stronger identity preservation. High values can resist requested changes or over-copy the reference.
- **Scene likeness** appears with two references. Image 1 supplies the scene; Image 2 supplies the subject. With one image, Subject likeness controls that image. In image editing workflows, the source image comes before any additional reference.
- **Grounding resolution** caps the reference image's longest edge for the vision encoder, from 384 to 1536 pixels. The default is 768. Lower values can favor edits; 1024 can help preserve reference detail but uses more memory. The trained range is 384–768, so higher values are experimental. This does not change output resolution or the VAE reference size, and smaller source images are not enlarged.

RAW and Turbo remember these choices independently across model switches and restarts. Each queued job keeps its submitted values. Generated image information records the controls; **Load settings**, reroll and saved presets restore them for repeatable comparisons.

Identity Edit preserves the aspect ratio and content of uploaded references before grounding, then fits their latent tokens to the output grid. A portrait reference used for a landscape output is not padded into a wide image before the grounding encoder sees it. Likeness values are a tuning aid rather than a guarantee; compare with the same prompt, references and seed. Turbo always runs with guidance disabled, so its ineffective Guidance Scale control is hidden. RAW retains adjustable guidance.

## Gallery scope and search

The gallery folder picker offers **All folders** as a browse-only scope. It includes
the default output directory and named folders without changing where the next
generation saves. The **All** media tab still means every media type in that scope.

Search matches filenames, original prompts and enhanced prompts across all results,
including items beyond the first page. Media type, Favorites and Multi-clip filters
apply before pagination. Each result shows its source folder; use that label to open
the folder. Favorites, deletion, download, reference reuse and Editor import retain
that origin even when another folder contains an identically named file.

Click a thumbnail on the right to bring that asset into the gallery and keep it
selected while media details load or new results arrive. Scroll the main gallery
to resume selecting the card being browsed.

Gallery cards show a local date and time. Open **Info** for the exact timestamp,
file size, measured resolution, and video/audio duration. Videos also show their
frame rate and frame count when recorded in the file. Dates are labeled Generated,
Processed, Uploaded, or File date according to the available record.

Upscaled and enhanced outputs include a **Processing** section: method (such as
DLSS, FlashVSR or Lanczos), spatial multiplier, before/after dimensions, source,
processing time, and frame-rate changes or DLSS settings where applicable. New
outputs retain these measurements even after the source is removed. Older Tools
outputs recover available details from saved settings and an existing source;
unknown dimensions are left unknown.

In **Uploads**, choose **More → Delete upload**, then click again to confirm.
This removes the uploaded source and its metadata, while generated outputs stay.
Saved setups that reference the removed source will need a replacement upload.
Maestro refuses deletion while an active or queued Studio job or active Director
project still uses the file. A locked-file error leaves the item visible for retry.

## Characters and media

The gallery **More** menu offers **Use as…** actions for the inputs available in
the current sidebar mode. Images and captured video frames go to image inputs;
videos go to video inputs; audio goes to soundtrack, voice or audio-reference
inputs. Destination labels identify the role, including individual voices.

Choosing an audio or video destination opens a trim preview. Use the waveform or
filmstrip handles, enter exact start/end times, or choose a 3-, 5- or 10-second
excerpt from the selected start. **Preview selection** plays that range;
**Zoom to selection** makes short excerpts from long clips easier to adjust.
**Use selection** creates a separate excerpt and sends it to the chosen input.
**Use full clip** skips trimming. The gallery original stays unchanged, and the
destination's usual file limits still apply. Current-frame image actions remain
one-click actions.

**Characters** uses the same person icon in Reference, supported Image, Viggle and Speech workflows. It opens the saved library beside the sidebar on desktop and in a sheet on mobile. A Reference character remains one card containing its appearance and voice. Speech uses its saved voice; Image uses chosen original or recovered views. Viggle can prepare a character replacement frame or accept a manually edited frame.

Reference mode shows compact input cards and keeps one **Add reference** drop zone while the selected model has room. Drop files or tap to choose them. Click a card to expand its name, type and supported options directly beneath that thumbnail row. The fields flow with the sidebar instead of covering the prompt. Use the eye button for a larger preview; replacement, image/audio roles, video soundtracks and background isolation remain available. Drag thumbnails to reorder them, or focus a thumbnail and use Alt+Left/Right. Reference labels update with their order, and saved character appearance and voice move together. Escape closes the inline settings and returns focus to the thumbnail. Larger input collections scroll together with the prompt.

For H3 image references, **Object / prop** preserves the pictured object's design, shape, proportions, materials, colors and details while ignoring its source scene, framing, background and pose. The prompt chooses where it appears, its scale and action, and how many copies appear. Object references remain **Pictures** rather than saved-character identities. **Isolate object background** is available when the source background gets in the way. For example: “AT-ATs matching <Picture 2> advance in the background and fire at Chewy.”

Frames and Extend use the same compact, three-column tile layout as Reference mode, including on mobile. They keep their specific input roles: source video, start/end/timed frames, control video, soundtrack and supported references. Tiles wrap instead of scrolling sideways. Frame positions and per-input settings stay with their inputs. Image and Viggle keep their model-specific source/mask and preparation controls. Files still count against each model's real limits.

## Long source media across windows

In **Frames**, upload the full control video and choose the output duration and
window count. Each native sliding window reads the matching part of the control
video and mask. Source-video audio or an uploaded soundtrack uses the same
timeline. Separately rendered clips also advance through a shared control video
by their assembled durations, including any trimmed clip tails.

In H3 **References**, ordinary uploaded videos default to **Follow window
timeline**. Each window uses the corresponding source segment, including its
embedded or attached soundtrack when **Include soundtrack** is enabled. Window
overlap reads the same source times again to preserve continuity. Turn off
**Follow window timeline** to reuse a short motion or appearance sample. Saved
character videos default to reusable samples; encoded RefMods stay reusable.

With **Duration → Auto**, loading a video with **Follow window timeline** enabled
sets the total duration to its full length and plans the required windows. With
several timeline videos, Auto follows the longest; they run in parallel rather
than one after another. Replacing or removing a video updates the recommendation,
even while the Duration popup is closed. Reusable character samples and RefMods
do not set the duration. Turn Auto off, or choose a time or window count, to keep
a manual runtime when loading videos. Model frame timing and the one-hour total
duration limit still apply.

**Music / performance timeline** takes precedence over video length and retains
its exact soundtrack behavior, setting the duration to the soundtrack length.
**Music / sound style only** follows the source timeline across windows; later
windows receive silence once the clip ends. H3 borrows its sound or music style.
**Voice reference** remains a reusable identity sample.

**Sound effect reference** guides generated effects by their sound and timbre.
Each window gets the same short sample. Describe the effect and when it happens
in your prompt. H3 generates matching sound; it does not play or loop the exact
waveform or set total duration.

H3's 15-second combined video-reference budget applies to each window. With one
long video, its segment covers up to 15 seconds of the window; with several
videos, Maestro shares that budget and takes a shorter segment from each at the
same window start. Originals
stay untouched. Timeline references hold their final frame and pad audio with
silence if the selected output continues beyond the source.

## Advanced

**Advanced** opens directly above its button on desktop and mobile, within the sidebar and clear of Generate. Its contents scroll when necessary. Expand any combination of sections; their open state, settings and unfinished preset drafts are retained when the overlay is closed. Sections with no applicable controls are hidden. Available options still appear when switched off. When a model does not accept additional LoRAs, **Presets** remains available to save and restore its settings.

- **Performance:** H3 optimizations, reference preparation detail, applicable text encoders/decoders and cache tuning. Existing compatible settings and defaults are retained.
- **Finishing:** face refinement, H3 audio refinement and supported post-processing, including scaling, temporal upsampling, grain and voice replacement.
- **LoRAs & presets:** creative adapters, strengths and saved setups.
- **Generation:** seed, guidance, inference steps, output count and other applicable model controls.

H3 Fused 4-Step **Frames** and **References** support **4–12 Total Steps**, with four as the default. Studio remembers the last selected or used step count separately for each model, including steps applied from a recipe or restored output when submitted. These preferences survive refreshes, restarts and a changed Pinokio port; restored counts respect model limits and fixed-step acceleration modes. Other job inputs such as prompt text, seed and uploaded references are not restored by this preference.

Each section heading shows a circular badge when it has active settings, including while collapsed. For example, one enabled adapter gives **LoRAs & presets** a **1** badge. The Advanced button totals the same section counts; badge tooltips list the settings. Controls located elsewhere, such as video's Window Length override in Duration, do not add to Advanced's count. **Face refinement & character mapping** in the Reference character library opens the same Finishing settings. Gallery face refinement remains available for previous videos.

The green LoRA info button opens its usage guide. Guides stay within the visible screen, including with the mobile keyboard open, and long text can be scrolled. Hover for a quick look or click/tap to keep the guide open. Escape dismisses the guide first, leaving Advanced open; tapping elsewhere or pressing the info button again also dismisses it. The same guide behavior is shared by Studio and Director's LoRA pickers.

## Generation previews

Open **Settings → Performance → Generation Preview** and choose **Fast Frames**, **Clearer Frames (Tiny VAE)**, **Live Video (Tiny VAE)** or **Off**. **Live Video** is the default when no choice has been saved; existing choices are preserved. The choice applies when the next generation begins, including queued jobs, and does not require disabling Performance Auto.

The preview appears inside Studio's **Generating…** card while progress and ETA remain visible. Its label identifies the current clip and window. Live Video loops silently; click the video or use its pause/play button to pause playback while generation continues. The pause choice survives refreshed previews and window changes for that job.

Previews show approximate intermediate output, with reduced resolution and frame rate. They can add GPU work and generation time. Tiny VAE supports H3 and supported Wan/LTX variants; other models use Fast Frames where available. Audio-only jobs do not show video previews. A preview failure leaves generation running. Temporary previews clear when a job finishes or is cancelled and are not gallery outputs. See [preview details and API](Generation-preview.md).

## Prompt and actions

The prompt fills the available composition area without a label or expand button. It grows to fit longer scripts and shrinks again when text is removed, without its own scrollbar. Scroll anywhere over the prompt or references to move through the shared sidebar area, including the mode controls at the top. Its text width stays steady as content grows or background status updates arrive. The active caret line stays visible while typing or navigating a long script.

The magic button at the bottom-right runs **Enhance** now and leaves the result available for review and editing. For H3, one adaptive writer preserves specified events, identities, restrictions and exact speech while developing what the brief leaves open. A short mountain-fight concept can become a complete scene with distinct fighters, connected choreography, motivated camera coverage and practical sound. A detailed timed script keeps its story and ending. A requested conversation receives dialogue sized to the selected duration; visual action alone does not request speech.

AI-written dialogue follows its scene action, so a greeting stays with the arrival and a later exchange stays with that discussion. Every event and spoken line has a reserved place in the camera plan, including the final speaker's response. A necessary entrance or move into another room can precede the line in a separate action phase. Speaking shots reserve time for their complete lines before allocating silent setup and reactions. Maestro can shorten newly written lines to fit that shot while retaining speaker roles and visual staging; exact user-supplied quotes remain unchanged. The final dialogue review uses the time available for speaking after camera staging and edits. A draft that still needs dialogue edits is saved for review and pauses unattended generation; Maestro does not ask you to extend your original prompt's duration to accommodate extra words the AI wrote.

The writer is guided to describe motion and sound literally while preserving how requested abilities work. Superhuman flight uses posture, wind and clothing movement to convey speed; speed metaphors should not introduce jet propulsion or glowing trails. Explicitly requested flames, thrusters, magic and other effects remain part of the scene.

The arrow beside the wand offers **Enhance now** and **Enhance on generation**. The latter adds a removable badge above the generation controls. Generate submits the job immediately, even while another job is running; Add to Queue captures it as a held job for **Run queue**. Either action captures the original prompt, model, references, settings, workspace and writer selection. Later Studio edits belong to another job. A one-time choice clears only after successful submission; a failed submission keeps that choice.

**Use by default**, beneath Enhance on generation, is off until you enable it. It remembers your choice across restarts and Pinokio port changes for supported Studio video and image generation. You can open the wand menu with an empty prompt to change this preference. Clicking the badge's **×** skips enhancement for the next submission; after it is accepted, the saved default applies again. **Enhance now** satisfies the default for that completed prompt or reviewed window plan, so generation does not enhance it a second time. You can still explicitly select Enhance on generation to request a new enhancement of that draft. Turn off Use by default to return to choosing enhancement per job.

Without that badge, Generate and Add to Queue use the visible prompt or reviewed window plan. Legacy saved Manual/Auto/Creative choices do not arm enhancement. Image and other video models retain their existing faithful enhancement adapters. Speech retains its separate speech/dialogue menu.

An opted-in job progresses through Waiting, Enhancing, Generating and Complete on the server, using one generation slot. Maestro releases the prompt model before loading diffusion. Closing the browser does not break the chain. After an app restart, interrupted jobs return to the held queue for an explicit resume; a completed draft is retained instead of being written again.

Open the generation queue and choose **View prompts** to view the saved source and draft, including individual H3 windows. Successful jobs sit in a **Completed** section that starts collapsed, with a count and **Clear completed** action. Completed history does not increase the active queue badge. Clearing it removes successful queue entries while keeping generated media, Director projects and their references; failed, cancelled, queued and running work stays available. Failed removals remain visible for another attempt. Failed enhancement stays visible with **Needs attention — review prompts** and lets other waiting work proceed. A source-based fallback requires review before unattended generation. **Generate all N windows with this draft** queues the complete job using the displayed prompts, including any flagged drafts, without another enhancement pass. **Retry window N & generate** (or **Retry flagged windows & generate**) repairs only flagged H3 windows, keeps the other prompts and story schedule, then generates the complete job if checks pass. **Edit prompts in Studio** loads the saved draft without starting generation. Under **Other options**, **Rewrite all prompts & generate** starts enhancement over, and **Generate all N windows from original prompt** skips the AI draft entirely. Retrying a generation failure reuses its completed enhancement. Cancelling stops the whole job. Dismissing a saved job removes its queue history, not generated media.

The same workflow is available through the [Studio enhancement API](Studio-enhancement-api.md).

New H3 drafts save their camera-planning checkpoint with the job, including across restarts. In the interactive **Exact H3 prompts** review, **Retry window N** repairs only the flagged windows and does not start generation. Their entry/exit states stay fixed so passed neighbouring prompts remain unchanged. Changing source text, media, timing or manually editing window prompts invalidates the old repair checkpoint. Older drafts without a checkpoint and shared-story problems still need a full rewrite.

For a long H3 sequence, Enhance prepares the individual window prompts. **Exact H3 prompts** opens their review screen, where each prompt remains editable. For LTX, enhancement writes one line per window directly in the prompt field. You can also choose a duration/window count and write those lines yourself. A missing window prompt produces an actionable message instead of triggering AI at submission. Auto duration estimates from the story or timed media; an old prompt-mode setting does not reinterpret paragraphs as separate windows. Previously queued jobs retain their original behavior.

Detailed prompts copied from another video tool can include character profiles, camera directions, VFX notes, and a timed shot list. H3 Enhance recognizes inline Character A/B or Role A/B profiles and explicit timed blocks, including titled ranges such as `【0.00—4.00｜Opening exchange】`, even when a paste loses its line breaks. Timed blocks keep their choreography together and their relative durations within each selected window. Character descriptions and production notes supply shared context instead of becoming extra story events or spoken words. Compound production headings such as **Visual requirements** and **Final state**, including quoted visual descriptions, remain outside the speech budget. Scene-wide requests such as **no dialogue** or **music only** keep ambiguous unquoted character notes silent; supplied quoted or tagged speech still receives dialogue timing checks. Explicit slow-motion beats are preserved when requested, while explicit prohibitions remain constraints. Choose the intended duration/windows in Maestro before enhancing, then review **Exact H3 prompts**: writing "30 seconds" in a pasted prompt does not override a selected 28-second output.

The **Recipes** book icon between Characters and Resolution opens saved generation setups directly. The **Model Browser** globe beside the model selector opens browsing directly. Browse is also available inside the model picker. Generate keeps its two-part action: the left side generates now, and the right third adds the current settings to the held queue when supported. Transform and Blend retain their existing queue limitations. Specialized audio and finishing tools retain their dedicated composers or Run actions.

For detailed scripts, Maestro keeps the source events in order and the ending in the final window. The AI adapts complete action and camera descriptions together, preserving causes, movement and consequences while condensing repetitive prose. Their event assignments stay paired during compilation. Shared character guidance retains supplied appearance and roles, and the next window starts from the previous window's physical ending. Exact dialogue, reference bindings and native clip durations remain explicit. Short outlines use AI to develop intermediate progression. H3 keeps its native three-field base or six-field Ref2VA format; identity references are not automatically first frames, and an image reference does not imply a voice reference.

The final H3 compiler preserves complete action and sound descriptions. A developed event can continue across several camera shots; each shot advances the choreography, and exact dialogue is attached once. The prompt token target is advisory; it does not cut or discard unique story content. Incomplete camera JSON is rejected rather than silently repaired into an apparently successful draft. If a camera plan needs a fallback, the review includes the specific reason for that window. Restart the backend after an update, then run Enhance again to replace an older prepared draft.

In H3 Frames mode, the start image establishes the opening appearance, pose, contact, camera composition, location and lighting. When adapting a pasted script, Enhance resolves requested replacements against that image and stages the transition from its visible pose into the first scripted action. Identity references in Reference mode retain their separate role and do not impose an opening pose. The original source remains available for comparison, and silent authored action keeps its timing through dialogue review.

H3 camera writing plans the action before selecting its coverage. A strike, contact or defense, and immediate reaction belong together; later views continue the resulting flight, landing or recovery. Several exchanges within an event can have distinct camera angles and movements. Established landmarks, travel direction and damage carry through cuts so another angle does not imply another impact. Brief requested slow-motion accents return to the requested action speed, and developed fights use counters and recoveries to drive the next exchange. Explicitly requested pauses, repeat strikes and replays remain part of the source.

Enhance also distinguishes the source of movement and visual effects. A body thrown by a punch continues from that impact; innate flight does not require glowing footwear or exhaust. Displaced dust and brief contact shockwaves remain separate from continuous propulsion. Explicitly requested jet boots, thrusters and other powered equipment retain their effects. The planner records these mechanics separately from reference bindings and carries them into each window's shared visual guidance. The final Reference prompts retain that complete guidance, including ability mechanics written after the opening style description.

The LLM stays loaded throughout H3 enhancement, including validation, repair, and individual camera-planning passes. Concurrent calls cannot start the idle-unload countdown while another call or planner is still working. Normal idle memory release resumes when the final active request finishes.

All three theme families, their light/dark variants and Auto appearance remain available in Settings. On mobile, the sidebar follows both the height and vertical offset of the visible viewport, and the document behind the open drawer is held in place. Keyboard detection also handles browsers that reduce the window height along with the visible viewport. The workflow header, reference area and hardware status temporarily tuck away while the keyboard reduces the available height, leaving room to write without changing saved preferences. An input section containing the focused text field stays visible. Compact menus also follow their buttons when the keyboard moves the viewport.

When editing a video frame in Image mode, the return banner keeps its title and actions while its help text tucks away during typing. On short desktop and mobile screens, the composer keeps a usable minimum height and the sidebar body scrolls above the fixed generation controls. Focusing a field or moving the keyboard reveals the active line inside the sidebar, including Animate's appearance controls, without scrolling the gallery behind it.

Pasted briefs can use Markdown, bracketed headings or plain section labels. Character descriptions and production notes remain shared scene context; their labels do not create spoken lines or consume dialogue duration. An explicit speech declaration or a subsequent screenplay section still preserves exact dialogue. Numbered time ranges such as `1. 0–4s` retain their shot boundaries, and splitting those shots does not reinterpret camera labels as speakers.

Single-window enhancement and multi-window planning recognize the same `Name: dialogue` form, including unquoted lines. Missing supplied lines trigger the existing repair path, with their named speakers retained. Silence restrictions also recognize shared conjunctions such as “no narration or dialogue.”

Effect checks compare positive requests with positive actions: an authored cursed-energy effect can be described as an energy field without an automatic camera fallback. Unrelated mechanisms remain separate, and a negative instruction neither permits that effect nor counts as performing it.

## Local validation

After building `ui`, run `node tests/ui/sidebar_redesign.cjs http://127.0.0.1:<Maestro port>`. The suite reads only the running app's model catalogue and model options. All browser writes, uploads, generations and enhancements are intercepted at an isolated test origin. It checks layouts, menus, simulated keyboard height/offset changes, and explicit enhancement/submission behavior. Screenshots are saved under `.codex-tmp/sidebar-validation/`. Set `MAESTRO_UI_ENHANCE_ONLY=1` to run just the enhancement checks during development. Keyboard geometry is simulated in Chromium; real iOS keyboard animation still needs device validation.

Additional existing checks cover Studio duration convergence, saved H3 LoRA settings, character recovery/picking, and automatic/manual Viggle submissions. These UI checks do not run a GPU generation.

Set `MAESTRO_UI_DURATION_ONLY=1` to run the duration popup checks alone. They drag the sliders across single/multiple-window boundaries with manual and automatic window sizing, verify sidebar bounds at desktop and mobile widths, and exercise scrolling and a simulated keyboard viewport.

Set `MAESTRO_UI_KEYBOARD_ONLY=1` to check the Animate-to-Image frame editor and Animate appearance field at 390px and 320px widths. It verifies typing, caret visibility, sidebar scrolling and the return action while simulating both visual-viewport-only and window-height keyboard changes.

Set `MAESTRO_UI_SCROLL_ONLY=1` to check the combined sidebar scroller, including short desktop windows and expanded hardware status. It exercises mouse-wheel scrolling over the prompt, growing/shrinking scripts, stable sizing during status polling and writing-extension updates, pinned actions, and mobile caret visibility while the keyboard changes size.
