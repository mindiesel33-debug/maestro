# Blaine — Maestro tutorial presenter

A 14-window tutorial with the same 457 spoken words, regrouped from the original 28 sections. Set the native window length to **14.4 seconds**. With the default continuation overlap, the expected finished video is **3 minutes 11.5 seconds**. Dialogue targets **2.8 words per second** while speaking, followed by a brief silent hold for changing the screen demonstration.

## Paste-ready prompt

Open [blaine-maestro-reference-manual.txt](blaine-maestro-reference-manual.txt), select all, and paste it into Maestro's prompt field. The file has exactly **14 non-empty physical lines**, one complete native H3 Reference prompt per window. Each line contains all six Context-IR fields and one explicit `<d>[English] ...</d>` dialogue block. Maestro restores the field separators at the model boundary. Visual word wrapping is fine; keep the actual line breaks. The headings, timestamps, and screen-recording cues in this guide are not part of the generation prompt.

## Maestro setup

1. In Studio Video, choose Reference and an H3 Reference model.
2. Add only the saved character Blaine. The prompts bind his image to `<Picture 1>`, visible identity to `<Subject 1>`, and voice to `<Audio 1>` for speaker `(S1)`. Keep the audio assigned as Voice reference.
3. Choose landscape 16:9. Blaine stays centered; resize and position the presenter video in the corner during editing.
4. Keep one complete native prompt on each physical line. These prompts are already structured; the magic-button enhancement is optional and Generate uses the supplied text.
5. Open **Duration**, lock **Window Length** and set it to **14.4 seconds** (345 frames). This example uses a manual GPU override; Auto recommends a duration for the selected model, resolution and GPU.
6. In Duration, choose **Window** and set **14 windows**. Confirm the prompt counter reads **14/14**.
7. For the continuous timing below, keep **Carry motion and sound between windows** enabled with the default 18-frame overlap. In **Advanced → Generation**, choose **Continuous take per clip** for Sequence Camera Coverage.

The displayed 14.4-second window is exactly 14.375 seconds at 24 fps. The first window contributes 14.375 seconds; each later window contributes 13.625 seconds after overlap. Total: 191.500 seconds. The prompts contain 31–34 words each, spoken in approximately 11.07–12.14 seconds at 2.8 words per second. Their opening pause is 0.25 seconds; the remainder is an explicit silent, closed-mouth hold.

For a static presenter assembled over a screen recording, turn **Carry motion and sound between windows** off if long continuation degrades the appearance. Each clip then starts independently from the saved character reference. Fourteen full 14.375-second clips total 201.250 seconds before any editing, and cuts can be placed between tutorial sections.

For a framing and voice check, use [the first-window prompt](blaine-maestro-reference-first-window.txt) with **one 14.4-second window**. It now includes both the welcome and workspace introduction. For the complete tutorial, use all 14 lines and 14 windows.

## Presenter direction

Blaine sits in a fixed chest-up shot against a neutral warm-gray background, wearing a plain charcoal crewneck. His head and shoulders remain visible with room for cropping. Lighting, framing, voice identity, and wardrobe stay consistent. Natural blinking and small facial movements make the delivery conversational; hands remain below frame. Record Maestro's real interface separately, then place that recording below the presenter layer in your edit.

## H3 format and pacing

These prompts follow Maestro's [Reference enhancement guide](../../app/services/llm_guides/enhance/minimax_h3_ref2va_video.md), [dialogue and timed-silence guide](../../app/services/llm_guides/enhance/minimax_h3_video.md), and [Reference sequence guide](../../app/services/llm_guides/enhance/minimax_h3_reference_sequence.md): six fields, explicit Subject/Speaker/Audio bindings, literal dialogue tags, a silent closing interval, nonverbal ambience, and music set to N/A. Speech is planned at 2.8 words per second, within the new 3 words per second ceiling.

The original spoken wording is unchanged. The script's advice to put dialogue in quotation marks refers to ordinary Maestro prompts, which the enhancer/compiler converts to native H3 tags. This Manual file supplies those tags directly.

The timing is a generation instruction, not forced audio alignment. Listen to the first-window test for repetitions or improvised speech before committing to the complete tutorial.

## Dialogue and screen-recording cues

These are approximate global editing ranges. Align your screen recording to the actual generated speech. The local intervals describe only each window's new footage; later windows already account for overlap. Use prepared outputs and Director projects so demonstrations do not require waiting through generation on camera.

### 01. Welcome / Workspaces — 0:00.000–0:14.375

> Hey, I'm Blaine. Let me show you how I use Maestro to create, organize, and edit media. First, choose a workspace. Separate workspaces help me keep experiments and finished projects organized.

Show on screen: Preview the assembled timeline, then show the export panel and settings. Then Hold on the finished project or a clean overview of Maestro.

## Editing notes

Place the screen recording on a lower video layer and the presenter on a layer above it. Crop the presenter as needed, scale him down, and choose the corner that covers the fewest important controls. The background is a clean rectangular camera background. Keep the presenter voice prominent and use the silent holds to switch screen demonstrations.

This script follows the features documented in the local Maestro v2.0.1 README and current UI. Only supported LTX workflows are described as using control video, and LoRAs are described as model-dependent.
